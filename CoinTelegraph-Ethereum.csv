Claiming a combined total of $943 million in cryptocurrency assets as of March 31, 2023, the filing shows a 56% increase over the company’s previous quarter where PayPal disclosed $604 million.

PayPal’s reported total financial liabilities for this quarter were $1.2 billion, with crypto assets making up 77.9% — up more than 10% from 2022’s reported fourth quarter liabilities.

According to the report, PayPal considers its crypto assets a “safeguarding liability” due to the “unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies.” The disclosure also indicates that the specific cryptocurrencies held by the company remain unchanged since last quarter:

“We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively, ‘our customers’ crypto assets’).”

Custody of the assets PayPal holds on behalf of its customers remains limited to third-party holding companies. PayPal recognizes that this presents a liability for customers in the event that third parties are unable to process transactions — a statement carried over from last quarter’s filing — however, the filing also indicates that no such fault has yet occurred:

“As of March 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value.”

The Q1 2023 cryptocurrency asset breakdown for PayPal includes $499 million in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,776

 (up from December’s $291 million), $362 million in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 (up from $250 million), and $82 million composed of Bitcoin Cash 

BCH

$121

 and Litecoin 

LTC

$80.31

 (up from $63 million).

PayPal’s profitability also increased in the first quarter. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company disclosed per-share earnings of $0.70, up from $0.43 in the first quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, PayPal’s per-share earnings were $1.17, up from $0.88 in the first quarter of 2022.

A single trader just spent a staggering 64 Ether — equivalent to $118,000 — in gas fees purchasing $155,000 worth of a memecoin called Four (FOUR).

According to an update from the popular blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, the lone trader paid an astonishing $119,157 in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 to complete a Uniswap trade that swapped 84 Wrapped Ether (WETH) for 13.8 billion FOUR tokens.

It appears as though the trader voluntarily increased their gas fee to speed up the transaction time to purchase the memecoin. According to pseudonymous Twitter user FlurETH, the trader in question is sitting on 133 ETH ($245,667) in unrealized profit on their investment in the memecoin.

Gas fees on the Ethereum network have become the subject of debate amongst the crypto community, with a number of prominent Etheruem advocates praising the heightened activity for its revenue generating effects and long-term deflationary pressure on the supply of Ether.

Others have leveled criticism at the fees, claiming that unless the network becomes more “affordable” mass adoption will never be achieved.

As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase in Ethereum gas fees comes from the recent memecoin mania, driven in large part by the frenzied buying of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE). At the time of publication, the average Ethereum transaction fee is sitting at $22.98, the highest level recorded since May 12, 2022, when the average fee reached a peak of $31.11.

Another major reason behind the drastic uptick in gas fees comes from the maximal extractable value trading bot that is front-running memecoin trades en masse. The notorious MEV bot and “sandwich” attacker, known only by the pseudonym jaredfromsubway.eth, has been profiting significantly from the heightened network use.

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

On April 18, Jared cleared a whopping $950,000 in profits from the sandwich attacks. Jared has also been one of the largest gas spenders on the Ethereum network. On April 20, Jared used 7% of the total gas on the network and spent 455 ETH in transaction fees.

The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) spearheaded a new era of digital ownership and investment. With a record number of new NFT collections launched in 2022, the NFT market capped $50 billion in sales volume for the first time. As a fast-growing market operating entirely in the digital world, however, it didn’t take long for the NFT industry to become a haven for fraudsters.

A recent report unveiled that in 2022, more than half of the NFT activity on the Ethereum blockchain, the most popular network for NFT trades, was fraudulent. From wash trading to copycat collections, the NFT market entered 2023 with a set of critical issues that could only be solved by advanced market intelligence and analytics. Assessing a fair price for an NFT is already tricky, as tremendous gaps between the floor price and the price ceiling are not uncommon for collections. On top of that, malicious market activity only adds more confusion to users’ NFT investment or trade decisions.

While NFTs from popular collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) hold immense value in the market, it’s relatively easy to copy the visual appearance of apes depicted in the collection as image files and then create fake NFTs based on copycat material. The $1.53 billion sales volume of the BAYC collection in 2022 presents a lucrative market for fake NFTs as well.

The impact of counterfeit NFTs

Fake NFTs created by copying the image of original art can be difficult to detect in the digital environment, resulting in significant financial losses for buyers. The impact of fake tokens in the NFT market includes economic, legal and reputational consequences. Investors who lose confidence in the ecosystem due to fake NFTs are less likely to return to the market. Without significant demand, the prices of NFTs are bound to drop.

Without proper tools, NFT collectors can quickly get confused trying to find an authentic NFT on the marketplace and trace its history. Luckily, recent tech developments in artificial intelligence (AI) now allow for the prevention of NFT buyers from investing in fake content. NFT analytics provider bitsCrunch recently launched an AI-powered tool that checks major blockchains and marketplaces for potential copycat or forged NFTs.

Fake NFTs caught by AI

By analyzing over 800,000 assets on the top NFT marketplace OpenSea against the top-40 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, bitsCrunch found out that 144 copycat NFTs are exact visual matches to the BAYC collection. Moreover, 231 NFTs were flagged as near-exact matches, while “extremely similar” copies are as high as 814.

The fake NFT issue is hardly exclusive to BAYC. Other trending collections, including Azuki, Otherdeed and CloneX, have tens of exact copies detected by AI-powered analytics. bitsCrunch detects forged material across blockchain networks and flags newly-minted and existing counterfeit NFTs by analyzing real-time data.

AI-powered price estimation for NFTs

Confusion across the NFT market also arises when users want to put a fair price tag on an NFT they aim to sell, as floor price — the lowest-priced item listed for a specific collection — rarely gives a reliable perspective.

Many factors, including trading volume and history, last traded price and the profile of previous buyers, come into account when deciding the final price of a digital collectible. However, AI can now aid buyers and sellers in the form of the NFT Price Estimation tool by bitsCrunch. Aiming to accurately determine the true value of NFTs, the Price Estimation tool uses analyzed historical info and metadata for an NFT combined with the social media hype around the collection to provide more accurate price estimates.

The AI-driven machine learning tool has studied over 30 million NFTs from more than 2,200 collections to apply advanced data and analytics, benefiting the user when making buying or selling decisions.

The full potential of the NFT space can only be unlocked via tools that fight against issues like wash trading and forgery plaguing the market for the last couple of years. Users need AI-powered advanced analytics and intelligence presented on easy-to-understand screens to benefit from market data.

bitsCrunch offers accurate NFT analytics and forensics with UnleashNFTs to supply users with reliable insights into the market. The platform provides in-depth analysis, research and statistics about the NFT ecosystem, helping buyers and sellers to make better decisions with each NFT trade.

Additionally, as part of its commitment to bring more awareness and data transparency to the NFT ecosystem, bitsCrunch has launched its startup program. Companies working with NFTs can join this initiative to get quick access to bitsCrunch tools for analyzing and managing risk via API. Equipped with AI-powered analytics, NFT creators, traders and businesses can detect and avoid malicious activities while making transactions, thus expanding the NFT ecosystem in a healthier direction.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been in correction mode, its current TVL of $50 billion representing less than a third of its peak in late 2021. The good news is that the market is preparing for another wave of DeFi adoption, primarily thanks to liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which have become the second-largest DeFi sector after decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

With the Shanghai upgrade already live since mid-April, we can see a gold rush of LST adoption, with the DeFi community embracing LSTs for their ability to be the “internet bond” and provide a native form of yield. This can lead to DeFi protocols racing to get ahead by integrating LSTs. The sooner that DeFi protocols integrate LSTs, the greater the chance to secure a better place in the upcoming DeFi race, as the Shanghai update is expected to boost demand for staking services that also provide yield opportunities.

This liquid staking protocol addresses main obstacles in LST space

Even before the impact of the Shapella upgrade becomes evident, liquid staking protocols are popular due to their unique functionality. Nevertheless, many of them deal with a range of pain points that impact user satisfaction. One of the challenges is the complexity of token models, which can create confusion for users who may struggle to understand the mechanics and implications of their investments. This complexity can stem from the varying tokenomics, reward structures, and risk profiles of different protocols, making it difficult for users to navigate the ecosystem and make informed decisions.

Another major issue is poor user experience, which can be attributed to the lack of user-friendly interfaces, inadequate documentation, and insufficient support services.

High fees are also a concern in some liquid staking protocols, as they can significantly eat into staking yields and reduce the overall attractiveness of liquid staking.

One of the few liquid staking protocols that is working to address these challenges is Swell, which lets users stake ETH and receive swETH to start earning rewards in DeFi. While there are many liquid staking options, Swell aims to fix all the issues and compile the best offerings into a user-friendly experience. Swell focuses on simplicity, enabling ETH stakers to seamlessly dive into the journey of DeFi through its noncustodial decentralized application (DApp).

Source: Swell

Besides an improved user experience, Swell is reducing fees to unlock more rewards for users. As a rule, the fee rate for staking ranges from 10% to 25%, and may go even higher. With Swell, users can expect no protocol fees for a limited period.

Swell is also putting a great emphasis on security, especially as the DeFi market has been plagued by hacking attacks and scams. The protocol is audited by high-profile blockchain security services including Sigma Prime.

Swell can help DeFi projects, including lending protocols, DEXs and yield farming services, attract more users and secure a continual growth of the sector’s TVL. Meanwhile, individual stakers can start earning rewards without any deposit barriers.

With the DeFi race driven by liquid staking gaining traction, Swell will contribute to the next DeFi transformation by helping DeFi protocols grow their communities while offering stakers the best yield opportunities.

Aave’s 

AAVE

$64.57

 community recently voted in favor of a proposal deploying on zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) platform zkSync Era, paving the way for the DeFi protocol to tap into powerful performance improvements delivered by the scaling infrastructure.

A number of different zk-proof-powered layer-2 protocols are being developed by Ethereum ecosystem participants, providing developers with a choice of infrastructure to scale their respective platforms.

While Aave has yet to deploy on zkSync Era, it has announced its deployment of v3 of its protocol on Optimistic Rollup scaling protocol Metis. The latest version of Aave’s protocol is touted to benefit users across both protocols, with Metis users set to benefit from the provision of DeFi borrowing and lending services.

Ethereum.org highlights the main difference between Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups. The former processes transactions off-chain before publishing data on-chain, with a timeframe for network participants to challenge the validity of transaction data.

Zk-Rollups, meanwhile, execute transactions off-chain and submit large batches on-chain using a single proof-of-validity, with no need for the network to validate the data.

The team from Metis highlighted a number of ways in which users of its ecosystem can benefit from Aave’s deployment. This includes borrowing assets with less collateral with Aave’s “high efficiency” mode, improved risk management with supply and borrowing caps, and siloed borrowing to reduce exposure to potential market contagion.

Aave’s “isolation” mode also increases the pool of collateral assets, its cross-chain portals provide access to wider DeFi solutions, and its gas optimization also reduces transaction fees.

Aave is renowned in the DeFi space, with over $5.5 billion in total value locked in the protocol. V3 of the DeFi liquidity protocol was deployed on Ethereum’s mainnet in January 2023 following its launch on a number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols, including Avalanche

Worldcoin, a project to identify humans and distinguish them from artificial intelligence, has launched a gas-free crypto wallet for verified humans, according to a May 8 announcement.

The new wallet, called “World App,” works on Android and iOS operating systems. It currently runs on the Polygon

$0.8785

 network, allowing users to hold and transfer United States Dollar Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, Dai (DAI), Ether 

ETH

$1,853

, Worldcoin (WLD) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

World App uses the project’s “World ID” system to discriminate between humans and bots. Users who want to take advantage of gas-free transfers must first register for a World ID by supplying a phone number or iris scan. Developers say the project doesn’t store users’ data. Instead, it generates a zero-knowledge proof to verify the user is human, but without revealing the data used to generate the proof.

Even users who don’t have a World ID can still use the app, but they can’t take advantage of the feeless transactions. The announcement said the app relies on account abstraction to allow for third-party gas payment.

The project has partnered with regulated crypto exchanges, including Moonpay and Ramp, to offer onboarding and offboarding within the wallet. Once coins are held in the wallet, they can be swapped through built-in Uniswap integration. Users can also connect their phone numbers to the app to send and receive crypto through phone contacts.

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Worldcoin Core team member Tiago Sada stated that the wallet was created to offer a simple option for inexperienced crypto users.

“When we first started, we actually just went out with normal wallets, the wallets a power user like me would use day-to-day, and it turns out those were too overwhelming for normal people. There were too many options, too many things to do, [it was] not super clear,"" he said. ""We’re launching [World App] as a product so that there is this alternative wallet that is focused just on simplicity.”

Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who also co-founded ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

Talking about nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the music industry usually means protecting artists’ copyrights and diversifying their revenue streams, preserving artworks on the blockchain, musicians collaborating with brands and artists, printing event tickets, giving exclusive bonuses to fans in this unique digital format or engaging with a community. So, why not do what the sports industry has done (and quite successfully so) with the NFT memorabilia format?

The sports memorabilia market reached $2.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to hit $227.2 billion in 10 years. The collectibles include sports trading cards, video clips of popular moments in the history of sports, autographs, accessories, and many other things that can be in both physical and digital formats. The same can be said for music memorabilia with rare vintage photos that already exist, sometimes only in unknown archives that are hard to access.

Unique classic rock history moments

This was the case with Legends of Rock, which was acquired by Globe Entertainment and Media back in 2020. The collection, which had been owned by British photo agencies and archives for decades, was then shipped to Las Vegas. Packed in standard postal containers, it looked unlikely to contain anything of high value or importance.

It was a total surprise for Klaus Moeller, CEO of Globe Entertainment and Media, to find some 8 million vintage, never-before-seen photos of the biggest rock stars — Queen, Deep Purple, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Frank Zappa, The Police, Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, The Who and many more. The pictures were taken on stage and during other official moments, but also backstage in a more relaxed atmosphere. The photos were made between the 1960s and the early 1980s, with some artists already in the spotlight and others just beginning their prolific careers. “It’s never-ending. Every day we’re finding the craziest stuff,” said Moeller about the archive.

To make the collection accessible worldwide, Globe Entertainment and Media partnered with MADworld, an innovative Web3 and digital asset ecosystem backed by Animoca Brands.

Moeller said:

“We could not have found a better partner than MADworld to introduce these unique, pivotal moments from music history to a new generation of fans. This collaboration is helping us breathe new life to these legends of music’s past by onboarding them onto Web3.”

Along with the physical slides, a professional-quality, high-resolution digital image of the original slides is provided to the buyer as a digital Certificate of Authenticity (COA) NFT. This helps prove ownership and guarantees authenticity. In addition, in the event of a future secondary sale, it allows the buyer to conveniently and securely transfer ownership.

Phillip Tran, chief marketing officer of MADworld, said:

“We are thrilled to be part of this exciting project. A global audience of music lovers, collectors and investors will now be able to use a secure, digital COA to verify each slide’s provenance through blockchain technology to simplify the authentication process and protect collectors from forgeries.”

On May 6, Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly $30 million in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, causing jitters in the market about a potential selloff event.

ETH price fell 4.8% to $1,900 on the day, but the decline has been negligible so far amid a wider recovery trend.

ETH price holding key support

Ether’s price recovered modestly to $1,920 on May 7 after testing its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $1,850 as support a day ago.

Moreover, the price volatility dropped on Kraken in the said period, per the contracting Bollinger Bands width in the chart above. That further shows traders’ calm amid the Ethereum Foundation transfer.

Notably, the 50-day EMA has capped Ether's downside attempts so far in 2023, barring the early March selloff that saw the price briefly falling below the red wave. Meanwhile, testing it as support has prompted the ETH price to pursue a breakout above $2,000.

As a result of this support, ETH bulls may attempt to take the price above $2,000 again.

Conversely, a drop below the 50-day EMA could have traders eye a support confluence comprising a multi-month ascending trendline and the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $1,700 as the next downside target, down about 13% from current price levels. 

Even with a larger decline, ETH would be maintaining its overall recovery trend when measured from its June 2022 bottom of $880. 

Ethereum exchange reserves vs. Kraken reserves

A rising exchange balance suggests potential selling pressure rising and vice versa. In Ethereum’s case, the balance remained lower across all the exchanges despite the Ethereum Foundation’s transferring $30 million into Kraken.

For instance, Kraken's Ether balance increased to 1.84 million ETH on May 6, from 1.83 million one day earlier.

Nevertheless, the balance across all exchanges actually dropped to 18.15 million ETH from 18.22 million ETH on the day, indicating that any potential sell-pressure from the Ethereum Foundation can easily be absorbed. 

Not necessarily a ETH market top

The Ethereum Foundation’s last big transfer was 20,000 ETH in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850, declining 80% thereafter. Similarly, the foundation sold 35,053 ETH at the local market top of around $3,500 in May 2021.

Many analysts treated these fractals as a sign of another possible market top formation near $2,000, arguing that the price may fall in the coming sessions.

But broader data suggests otherwise. For instance, Ethereum Foundation’s large ETH sales occurred also during the 2020-2021 bull cycle, boosted by growing demand for risk-on assets in a lower interest rate macro environment.

In other words, there’s little evidence to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation’s sales have any impact on Ethereum’s price trend. Instead, the cryptocurrency market is currently taking cues from the U.S. banking crisis and whether this will force the Federal Reserve to stop hiking and cut interest rates.

A bot initiated the hack on BSC, which led to a more than $1.3 million loss. The attacker also targeted the Arbitrum network, with ARB/ETH deployments losing over $5 million. Twitter users claimed the token contract had a basic implementation error as the root cause.

The protocol confirmed the attack, paused all contracts and burned DEI tokens to prevent further damage. “We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens,” said the Deus team on Twitter, adding that a “comprehensive recovery and redemption plan” will be created after a full analysis of the balances and snapshots.

DEI is used as a collateral mechanism for third-party instruments built on the Fantom protocol. Its price dropped 30% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The stablecoin is trading at $0.20 at the time of writing, losing its $0.30 peg. Last year, the stablecoin also lost its $1 peg after the Terra collapse.

It is not the first time that Deus Finance has been hacked. The protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a flash-loan attack, resulting in over $3 million in losses in Dai

$1,853

. At the time, PeckShield revealed the exploiters funneled the stolen funds using the crypto mixer Tornado Cash.

HOW TO
Join us on social networks

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is technically initiated by an external account owner (not a contract). For example, if User A sends 1 Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 to User B, the action of debiting from one account and crediting to another changes the blockchain’s state.

The change specifically takes place on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum transactions need to be broadcast to the entire network, and any node can broadcast a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.

After broadcasting the request, a validator can then execute the transaction and propagate the state change to the whole network. Transaction fees are incurred during the process of validation, and each transaction must be included in a validated block. There are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

Regular transactions: transactions occurring from one account to another.
Contract-execution transactions: transactions interacting with deployed smart contracts (the “to” address is a smart contract address).
Contract-deployment transactions: transactions with no “to” address (the data field is simply used to deploy the smart contract’s code).
How to check the status of an Ethereum transaction

Here’s a brief step-by-step guide on how to track Ethereum transactions:

Step 1: Select an Ethereum blockchain explorer

Some blockchain explorers are specific to Ethereum, such as Etherscan, Ethplorer and EthVM. Others support multiple chains, such as Blockchain.com and Tokenview, among others.

Step 2: Enter the transaction hash into the blockchain explorer’s search field

On Etherscan, for example, the search field is on the top, left-hand corner of the screen next to a dropdown that says “All Filters.” Depending on the tool, a user can search for information based on a wallet address, transaction hash (txid), block, token or domain name.

The txid is a unique identifier attached to a specific transaction. All transactions carried out on-chain, or those to and from external addresses, carry a unique txid found in the transaction details.

Depending on the platform, it can also be called a “hash” or “txn hash.” It usually looks like a string of random letters and numbers. On MetaMask, for example, a user can instantly see the txid upon clicking the “Activity” tab and selecting the transaction.

Other than the txid, traders can also use their public address (a string of 42 characters corresponding to their public account). In this case, they will be taken to an overview of their wallet activities, allowing them to navigate to the specific transaction independently.

Step 3: Click the icon for “search” or “enter” on the blockchain explorer

Step 4: Check if the transaction was successful or not

How to know if an ETH transaction was successful: Details indicating the state of the transaction will appear on the blockchain explorer. If the transaction was successfully validated and is now on the blockchain, it will say “success” or “successful.”

If there are no errors displayed, it means that the transaction was completed successfully. The ETH should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24 hours of sending.

In the event of an Ether transaction failure, on the other hand, several error messages can appear:

Error message or symbol: A red exclamation point or an error message saying “bad instruction” or “out of gas” means that the transaction was unsuccessful and the funds did not reach their intended destination. In the case of an “out of gas” error, users can double the gas limit they initially specified and try again.
Reverted: This pertains to a smart contract user error. It means that the user should double-check the details of the transaction.
Transaction not found: Either the transaction did not go through or it isn’t appearing on the blockchain explorer yet. Try using another explorer. If it still doesn’t appear on multiple ones, there’s a good chance it did not go through.
Pending: The transaction is still waiting to be validated or processed, but it was located in the explorer’s transaction pool. Sometimes pending transactions can still be canceled or replaced by a user.

How long does an Ethereum transaction take to process?

An average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain will typically take between 15 seconds and five minutes to process, depending on several factors. These include the amount paid to process it (transaction fee) and how busy the network is at the time of processing.

Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain after the Merge. However, transaction speeds remain roughly the same. According to the Ethereum Foundation, it’s a common misconception that the Merge drastically sped up transactions.

However, there’s a slight difference, with slots occurring precisely every 12 seconds post-Merge compared with every 13.3 seconds pre-Merge. In any case, the change is barely noticeable by most users, as processing still usually depends on network congestion and transaction fees.

When a transaction is initiated, it is logged into Ethereum’s memory pool (mempool) and waits for validators to pick it up. The mempool functions much like a waiting room where pending transactions are held.

Once a validator enters transaction data into a block and adds the block to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete. It is said to be finalized and irreversible after six additional blocks have been mined and added on top of it.

By checking a transaction’s status, traders can confirm whether their transaction has succeeded or failed and how many blocks have been created since their transaction was added to the chain.

Why should traders check a transaction’s status?

Ethereum participants must pay gas fees to use the network to transfer funds or deploy smart contracts. The fees largely depend on the number of participants waiting to execute transactions at a given time.

Network congestion and demand are thus directly proportional to transaction costs. When demand is high, costs rise — the opposite is true when demand is low. In any case, checking a transaction’s status helps a trader monitor the cost of using the network.

It can also help users determine if the gas fee they paid is sufficient to have their transaction confirmed. Low gas fees can usually truncate or delay transactions, leaving them to remain pending for long periods of time, especially during high network congestion.

Such transactions will remain pending until the gas fees reach the required minimum fees on the network. If this happens, a user can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and increasing the gas fee while ensuring it carries the same nonce.

In addition to transaction status, Ethereum blockchain explorers can also reveal the following helpful information:

Timestamp: the date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.
Block confirmations: the number of blocks mined since the transaction was confirmed.
Transaction fee: the fee paid to the miner or validator.
ETH price: the price of ETH at the time of processing.
Base fee: the lowest fee required to transact on Ethereum.
Gas limit: the maximum amount of gas the sender is allocating to process the transaction.
Nonce: a unique number marking each transaction executed on a user’s wallet; it increases by one each time a new transaction is sent.

By being aware of the above, traders can stay on top of their ETH transactions and make sure transactions are processed correctly and quickly. This helps to ensure smooth Ethereum transactions when sending and receiving funds or deploying smart contracts. Understanding a transaction’s status can also help users adjust their spending habits and optimize network usage.

SEC issues record whistleblower award of $279M

The $279 million figure is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its largest-ever whistleblower award totaling $279 million.

The SEC generally issues awards ranging between 10% to 30% of collected monetary sanctions larger than $1 million. To receive such an award, the whistleblower must provide information that directly assists the SEC in successfully imposing enforcement actions on a particular case.

In a May 5 statement, the SEC noted that the $279 million awarded to the unnamed whistleblower was more than double the previous record of $114 million from back in October 2020.

Additionally, the $279 million figure awarded in this latest case is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

Today we announced the largest-ever award, nearly $279 million to a whistleblower whose information and assistance led to the successful enforcement of SEC and related actions.https://t.co/GGwiZ4BQUf

— U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 5, 2023

“The size of today’s award — the highest in our program’s history — not only incentivizes whistleblowers to come forward with accurate information about potential securities law violations, but also reflects the tremendous success of our whistleblower program,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.

These awards come from an investor protection fund established by the U.S. Congress. It is funded via collected monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators and does not come from funds that are owed to harmed investors.

In these circumstances, the SEC does not refer to the specific case the whistleblower award relates to or the name of the whistleblower to protect their privacy.

As such, it is unclear if this relates to a major securities violation from the crypto sector or Wall Street.

Regarding the whistleblower, the SEC did note that they helped provide key info on a case it was already working on.

“The whistleblower’s sustained assistance, including multiple interviews and written submissions, was critical to the success of these actions,” noted Creola Kelly, the chief of the SEC’s office of the whistleblower.

“While the whistleblower’s information did not prompt the opening of the Commission’s investigation, their information expanded the scope of misconduct charged,” she added.

Confidence in the United States financial system seems to be eroding fast, with investors trying to find the next weakest link that is about to collapse. Bill Ackman, CEO of hedge fund management firm Pershing Square, cautioned that time was running out to fix the problem.

The U.S. equities markets have become vulnerable to adverse news on the regional banks, as seen from the sell-off in the past three days. Compared to that, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

 has held strong and is hovering near its critical overhead resistance at $31,000.

Bitcoin is not the only outperformer. Gold had risen close to its all-time high during the week. This shows that Bitcoin is currently behaving as a safe-haven asset and investors are adding it to their portfolios along with gold.

Could Bitcoin overcome the barrier at $31,000 and extend the up move? Will the altcoins follow Bitcoin higher? Studying the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies can help answer these questions.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Usually, the trend that was in force before the formation of the triangle tends to resume. That means the price is likely to break out to the upside.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price closes above the triangle, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $32,400. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level because if the bulls drive the price above $32,400, the rally could reach $40,000.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may continue its random price action inside the triangle for a few more days.

A break and close below the triangle will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then tumble to $25,250.

Ethereum price analysis

The bulls pushed Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 5. This shows that the bulls absorbed the supply and have come out on top.

If buyers sustain the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could first rise to $2,000 and then attempt a rally to $2,200. The bears may aggressively defend this level because if they fail to do that, the pair may skyrocket toward $3,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and re-enters the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then once again drop to the support line. A break below this level may sink the pair to the target objective of $1,619.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $326 and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair may continue to oscillate inside the triangle for some more time.

A break below the triangle will indicate that bears have seized control. That is likely to start a downward move to $300 and then to the pattern target of $280. If bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to propel the price above the triangle. That will clear the path for a possible rally to $350 and then $400.

XRP price analysis

XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 4 and a Doji candlestick pattern on May 5. This suggests that the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are not waging large bets.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, signaling that bears have a slight edge. The bears will try to sink the price to the strong support level at $0.43.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The XRP/USDT pair may then rise to the resistance line. Buyers will have to overcome this resistance to open up the possibility of a rally to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano 

ADA

$0.365

 dipped below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.38 on May 3 and 5, but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support near $0.37.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers tried to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.39) on May 4, but the bears did not budge. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and crumbles below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.33 and then $0.30.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. That could increase the chances of a rally to $0.46 and later $0.52.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bulls have managed to keep Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 above the immediate support near $0.08, but they have failed to achieve a meaningful bounce off it. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A tight consolidation near a strong support level generally resolves to the downside. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.08) and the RSI in the negative zone also indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

If the support near $0.08 gives way, the DOGE/USDT pair may tumble to the next major support level of $0.07. This negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers thrust the DOGE price above the downtrend line.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8785

 attempted to rise above the 20-day EMA ($1.02) on May 3 and 4, but the bears successfully protected the level.

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near 43 suggest that the bears are in command. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern. That could start a down move toward $0.69.

Instead, if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the lower levels continue to attract buyers. The pair could then rally to the resistance line where the bears are again likely to sell aggressively.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 has been trading in a tight range for the past three days. This suggests a state of indecision among the buyers and sellers.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the SOL/USDT pair may remain stuck inside the large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for some time. If the price slips and sustains below the 50-day SMA ($21.90), it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand in the near term. The pair could then slide to $18.70.

On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may start its march toward $24 and then $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Sellers yanked Polkadot 

DOT

$5.34

 below the $5.70 support level on May 3, but the long tail shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls again thwarted attempts by the bears to break the support on May 4 and 5.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The repeated failure to sustain the price below $5.70 may attract buyers. Bulls will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.96). If they do that, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($6.18). Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to gain the upper hand in the near term. The next target on the upside is $7.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on minor rallies. The sellers will then again attempt to tug the price below $5.70 and challenge the crucial support at $5.15.

Litecoin price analysis

The long tail on Litecoin’s 

LTC

$80.33

 May 3 and 5 candlestick shows that the bulls continue to guard the $85 level with vigor, but they are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle at the moving averages.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The LTC/USDT pair is stuck in a tight range as the bulls are buying on dips while the bears are selling on rallies. The 20-day EMA ($89) is sloping down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears. A break below the $85 level will indicate that bears have taken control. The pair may then collapse to $75.

Instead, if buyers propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $96. If the price turns down from this level, it will point to possible range-bound action between $85 and $96 for a few days.

Bitcoin transaction fees surged in early May, reaching their highest point over the past two years, according to data from Crypto Fees.

On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping about 400% from late April. The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached as much as $7.2, according to YCharts.

The latest increase in BTC transaction fees is primarily attributed to a surge in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20 transactions. According to data from Galaxy Research, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions on May 2 were related to BRC-20 transactions.

Modeled after Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard allowing users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The standard was introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst known as Domo.

The BRC-20 token standard has quickly become a major trend in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically amid the sharp growth of the PEPE memecoin. The token has rallied more than 600% over the past seven days, reaching its all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.

The Bitcoin blockchain isn’t the only blockchain affected by the ongoing memecoin hype. Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain have also been skyrocketing to new multi-month highs recently.

On May 2, ETH transaction fees hit an aggregate amount of more than $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees. The Ethereum blockchain remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees at the time of writing.

Despite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees were recorded in April 2021, when the average BTC transaction cost almost reached $70 amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. The previous highest point in BTC transaction fees was in 2017, with transaction costs surging above $60.

Join us on social networks

Anyone who has dealt with trading in traditional finance is likely to be aware of profit and loss (PnL). But is PnL in the cryptocurrency world the same? The ability to comprehend terms like mark-to-market (MTM), realized PnL and unrealized PnL will help develop a better understanding of the cryptocurrency a person holds.

Without a well-defined process to get insight into profit or loss, cryptocurrency trading may be overwhelming, and traders may struggle with what they are doing. PnL reflects the change in the value of a trader’s positions over a specific period. 

To gain a clearer understanding, let's examine it in the context of cryptocurrency trading.

Understanding the basics of PnL

PnL in crypto refers to the calculation of the profit or loss made on a cryptocurrency investment or trading position. It is a metric used to evaluate the financial performance of a trader or investor in the crypto market.

To begin, here are some key terms in PnL terminology:

MTM

MTM refers to the process of valuing an asset or financial instrument based on its current market price or fair value. For example, in the context of crypto trading, if an investor holds a certain amount of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

, the value of that Bitcoin will fluctuate based on the current market price.

The general formula for calculating PnL is:

Suppose the MTM price for Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 today is $1,970, while the MTM price yesterday was $1,950. In this case, the PnL is $20. It indicates a profit of $20. On the contrary, if the MTM price of ETH was $1,980 yesterday, it indicates a loss of $10.

Future value

Future value indicates the value of a digital coin at a future point in time.

For example, if a trader stakes Tron 

TRX

$0.0691

 worth $1,000 with a 4% yearly reward, how much will the person get back after a year? The answer is $1,040. At the time of staking, the present value will be $1,000, while the future value will be $1,040.

There will be a present value at the point when the trader stakes, but if the person considers the future as a whole, there could be countless future values.

There is a different way to use future value as well. Traders could ask how much to stake to get $1,040 in a year. If they know the present and future values, they could calculate the discount factor. The formula for calculating the discount factor is:

For the example given above, the discount factor will be:

Realized PnL

Realized PnL is calculated after traders have closed their position (sold the cryptocurrency they hold). Only the executed price of the orders is taken into account in realized PnL, and it has no direct relation to the mark price.

The mark price is the price at which a derivatives contract is valued based on the current market price of the underlying asset rather than the price at which the contract is being traded.

The formula for realized PnL is:

An example will help understand how to calculate realized PnL. If the entry price for buying X number of Polkadot 

DOT

$5.34

 is $70 and the exit price is $105, the PnL for the period is $35, which refers to a profit of $35. However, if the closing price of the trade was $55, the PnL will be $15, but it will reflect a loss.

Unrealized PnL

Unrealized PnL refers to the profit or loss that is currently held in open positions but has not yet been realized through closing the position. The formula for determining unrealized PnL is:

Donald has purchased ETH contracts with an average entry price of $1,900. The mark price of ETH is currently $1,600. The unrealized PnL for Donald is the difference between the average entry price and the mark price.

Unrealized PnL = $1,900 - $1,600 = $300

How to do PnL calculation

To determine PnL in cryptocurrency, a trader needs to find the difference between the initial cost of acquiring a digital coin and the current market value of the same coin. Various methods to calculate PnL in cryptocurrency are as follows:

First-in, first-out (FIFO) method

The FIFO method requires the seller to use the price of the asset from when it was first bought. Here is the process to calculate PnL using the FIFO method:

1) To settle on the initial cost of the cryptocurrency, multiply the purchase price per unit by the number of units sold.

2) To determine the current market value of the asset disposed of, multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

3) To find the PnL, deduct the initial cost from the current market value.

Suppose Bob first bought 1 ETH at $1,100 and a few days later bought 1 ETH at $800. A year later, he sold 1 ETH at $1,200. As he had first bought ETH at $1,100, this price will be considered the initial cost. Applying the FIFO method, Bob could calculate PnL as follows:

Bob's initial cost = (1 ETH x $1,100) = $1,100

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $1,100 = $100 (profit)

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method

The LIFO method requires the seller to use the most recent purchase price of an asset in the calculation. The other aspects are just like the FIFO method. Here is the PnL using the LIFO method using the same example as above:

Bob’s initial cost = (1 ETH x $800) = $800

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $800 = $400 (profit)

Weighted average cost method

The weighted average cost method requires traders to determine the average cost of all units of a digital currency in their portfolio to arrive at the initial cost. Here are the steps to calculate PnL using this method:

1) Determine the total cost of all units of the cryptocurrency. Multiply the purchase price per unit for each transaction by the number of units of the asset and add the numbers.

2) To arrive at the weighted average cost per unit of the digital coin, divide the total cost of all units by the number of units.

3) Find the current market value of the cryptocurrency sold. Multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

4) To determine PnL, subtract the average cost per unit from the current market value.

Suppose Alice bought 1 BTC at $1,500 and a few days later bought 1 BTC at $2,000. She later sold 1 BTC at $2,400. Here is the PnL using the weighted average cost method:

Total cost = (1 BTC x $1,500) + (1 BTC x $2,000) = $3,500

Weighted average cost = $3,500 / 2 BTC = $1,750

Current market value = (1 BTC x $2,400) = $2,400

PnL = $2,400 - $1,750 = $650 (profit)

Profits/losses from opening and closing positions

Analyzing open and closed positions at regular intervals is an efficient way to monitor performance. An initial purchase a person makes in the market is an open position, while selling the cryptocurrency is termed closing the position. If a trader buys 10 DOT, it is an open position. When the trader sells those DOT, the position gets closed.

For example, if a trader bought 10 DOT for $70 and sold them for $100, the person’s PnL would be $30 ($100 - $70). Regular analysis of trades in line with open and closed positions helps a person trade in an organized manner.

Year-to-date (YTD) calculation

YTD is a way to measure the performance of investments made in cryptocurrency from the start of the year to the current date. Investors who regularly buy and hold cryptocurrencies for years can know their unrealized profits with a YTD calculation. The trader just needs to calculate the value of the portfolio at the beginning and end of a year and compare these values. This could be a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on the person’s preference or requirements.

Suppose someone holds $1,000 worth of Cardano 

ADA

$0.365

 on Jan. 1, 2022 and $1,600 of ADA on Jan. 1, 2023. In this case, $600 is the unrealized profit. Unrealized profit denotes returns that haven’t yet been converted into cash or cash equivalents such as term deposits.

Transaction-based calculation

A transaction-based calculation requires a person to calculate the PnL for each specific transaction. For instance, if a person bought 1 ETH for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500, the PnL for the transaction would be $500 profit ($1,500 - $1,000). If the number of transactions is small and a trader needs to calculate PnL for these transactions separately, a transaction-based calculation is an ideal method.

Percentage profit

The percentage profit method reflects the PnL as a percentage of the initial cost. An example will help understand better. Suppose a trader buys 1 Binance Coin 

BNB

$314

 for $300 and sells it for $390. In this case, the person’s PnL would be $90 profit ($390 - $300). To arrive at the percentage profit, the trader needs to divide the PnL by the purchase price and multiply the amount by 100 (($90 / $300) x 100). This amounts to 30%.

However, please note that these are simplified examples that do not factor in variables such as taxes, trading fees paid to the platform, market volatility, etc. In real-life situations, a trader will need to take into account the specific context when calculating PnL.

How to calculate PnL of perpetual contracts

Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract with no fixed settlement time or expiration date. Traders can hold their long or short positions indefinitely, provided they have sufficient maintenance margin, which is the minimal amount of collateral needed for maintaining open trading positions.

When traders calculate the PnL of perpetual contracts in cryptocurrencies, they need to calculate both realized and unrealized PnL and then add them to determine the total PnL.

Here are the steps to measure PnL of perpetual contracts:

Again, this is a simplified way to explain the concept of calculating PnL for crypto perpetual contracts. When calculating total PnL in real life, a trader needs to take into account factors like trading fees and funding rates.

PnL calculations and associated tools

Understanding crypto PnL helps people know if their cryptocurrency portfolio is in profit or in loss. Gaining an insight into key parameters like cost basis, quantity, price of each trade and profitability of the portfolio helps traders assess the efficiency of their strategies and make necessary adjustments. Precise knowledge of the funds they have made or lost on a particular trade influences their upcoming trading decisions for the better.

Apart from PnL calculations, there are tools like specialized spreadsheets and automated trading bots that could help traders analyze their performances and zero in on profitable trading opportunities, regardless of their experience.

For the past 14 days, cryptocurrency markets have been trading within an unusually tight 7.1% range. In other words, investors are unwilling to place new bets until there’s additional regulatory clarity, especially in the United States.

The total crypto market capitalization fell by 1% to $1.2 trillion over the seven days ending May 4, primarily as a result of Bitcoin’s

Notice that the exact same $1.16 trillion–$1.22 trillion total market capitalization range previously stood for 12 days between March 29 and April 10. The conflicting forces: regulatory uncertainty weighing it down and the banking crisis pushing prices upward are likely the reason for the lack of risk appetite on both sides.

SEC’s crypto crackdown could backfire

The Coinbase exchange, for instance, has been battling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the need for clear rules for trading digital assets. The stakes were raised after the exchange was handed a Wells notice, a “legal threat” for “possible violations of securities laws,” on March 22.

However, the latest decision has been favorable to Coinbase, as the court has instructed the SEC to clarify the security rules for digital assets within 10 days.

On the other hand, the banking crisis seems not to have faded after the lender PacWest Bancorp reportedly announced that it was considering a buyout. The regional financial institution held $40 billion in assets, although some 80% of the loan book is dedicated to commercial real estate and residential mortgages — a sector that has been plagued by rising interest rates.

The recent crypto sideways trend suggests that investors are hesitant to place new bets until there’s more clarity on whether the U.S. Treasury will continue injecting liquidity to contain the banking crisis, which favors inflation and positive momentum for scarce assets.

BTC, ETH derivatives show muted demand from bears

Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.

A positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.

The seven-day funding rate for Bitcoin and Ether was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. BNB was the only exception, as shorts have been paying 1.4% per week to keep their positions open indicating bearishness.

To exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market’s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are used for bearish ones.

The expiration of options can have a significant impact on the market, particularly if there are a large number of contracts involved. When options contracts expire, the holders of these contracts may choose to exercise their rights, which can result in buying or selling pressure on the underlying asset. This can lead to increased volatility in the price of Bitcoin, which resulted in a $575-million advantage for bulls in the latest April 28 expiry.

A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.

The put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 0.90 since April 26, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $27,700 on May 1, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.

Traders pricing low odds of a break above $1.2 trillion

The options market shows whales and market makers unwilling to take protective puts even after Bitcoin crashed 7.8% on May 1. However, given the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there’s clarity on whether the U.S. Treasury will continue to bail out the troubled regional bank sector.

It is unclear whether the total market capitalization will be able to break through the $1.22-trillion barrier. But one thing is for sure: Professional traders are not betting on a crypto price crash, given that the demand for protective puts has been muted.

Consensus, the annual crypto and blockchain conference, attracted over 15,000 attendees, 220 sponsors and 410 speakers to its 2023 edition in Austin, Texas, despite recent regulatory struggles around cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. 

The turnout at Consensus 2023 demonstrated that U.S.-based companies and international organizations are still very much interested in implementing Web3 technology into their business models.

Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank — a Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the conference attracted serious ecosystem participants, saying, “We’ve seen during crypto winters before where Consensus gets overrun with high time preference people and companies (for example, multiple Lambo’s parked out front of the New York Hilton in 2018), and in bust years the low-time preference people and companies just keep building. This year was the latter.”

Businesses discuss Web3 strategies

Several large organizations were present at Consensus 2023, with Mastercard, Google, Robinhood and Coinbase, among others, gathering to discuss their Web3 strategies.

James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, told Cointelegraph about some blockchain-based initiatives the company has recently launched.

“At the end of last year, Google Cloud announced Blockchain Node Engine, which allows users and developers to run an Ethereum node without having to manage or support it themselves,” he said.

At Consensus, the firm announced that it had expanded support for the Blockchain Node Engine to Polygon proof-of-stake, in addition to Ethereum.

Tromans added that Google Cloud knows what Polygon has been doing in the zero-knowledge (ZK) space, noting that Polygon ZK Ethereum virtual machines (zkEVM) and Polygon supernets will benefit from the provision of Google Cloud’s infrastructure and developer tools.

Moreover, Tromans pointed out that Google Cloud’s startup program will help onboard companies interested in building on Web3 using existing Google Cloud products. “Polygon is an important part of this initiative, as they have provided a $3 million contribution from their venture fund to get this off the ground with us,” he said.

Global financial services giant Mastercard announced its “Mastercard Crypto Credential” solution during Consensus. Raj Dhamodharan, head of crypto and blockchain at Mastercard, stated during a fireside discussion at Consensus that he is “excited about the underlying potential of blockchain technology” due to its ability to store and move value seamlessly.

However, Dhamodharan explained that “this potential is not fully realized today,” so Mastercard has started working on several products like Mastercard Crypto Credential.

“I believe that once you have the right building blocks necessary for safety and simplicity, you can have more businesses building and relying on the basic utility of storing and moving value,” Dhamodharan said on stage.

Conversations continued at side events

While there were 10 dedicated stages for 285 panels during Consensus, many side events allowed important conversations to continue outside of the conference.

For example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) were widely discussed at Consensus, but in-depth conversations around ZK-proofs took place at the “ZK360” event hosted by Mina Protocol. Evan Shapiro, CEO of the Mina Foundation and co-founder of the Mina Protocol, told Cointelegraph that the goal of ZK360 was for attendees to learn about the latest advancements in ZK-proofs and how these can be applied in the real world. “Web3 needs both privacy and verified computation. ZK-proofs provide both of those at a time when applications are needing these features to be more effective, decentralized and scalable,” he said.

Other layer-1 blockchain networks like Ripple and Algorand hosted side events, allowing Consensus attendees to better understand specific blockchain offerings while networking with community members. These events also presented an opportunity for non-Consensus attendees to learn about important topics within the Web3 sector. 

Lacking an international presence

While the turnout during Consensus 2023 was notable, some industry experts highlighted that the conference lacked an international presence.

Yat Siu, chairman of Animoca Brands — a venture capital company focused on blockchain-based games — told Cointelegraph that regions in Asia like Japan and Hong Kong are offering a progressive and welcoming regulatory environment for crypto adoption. He noted that most people he spoke with at Consensus seemed surprised or even skeptical at this. He said:

“I think that a larger presence of overseas participants would have helped allow Consensus participants to better understand the scope of excitement and opportunity that exists outside of the United States. I would love to see a stronger international presence at Consensus next year.”

Despite this, Siu said that Consensus 2023 was a well-attended, high-energy conference overall. “I was surprised at the level of deal-making activity that was taking place, even if the narrative was that the U.S. was negative on crypto,” he said.

Echoing Siu was Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay. He told Cointelegraph that he was impressed to see so many executives from some of the largest companies in attendance at Consensus. “Deals were being discussed, and I believe we will look back at Consensus 2023 recognizing it represented a maturation in the industry as it relates to how Web3 technologies can be deployed in a meaningful manner for businesses and their customers.”

In episode 18 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast, Elisha Owusu Akyaw sits down with Matt Leisinger, chief product officer at Alluvial — a software development company supporting the implementation of the Liquid Collective protocol — to explore the world of crypto staking and its potential to attract institutional investors. Leisinger explains the Liquid Collective and shares his thoughts on the future of Ether

 staking after the Shanghai upgrade. 

Matt Leisinger started his carrier in the traditional finance sector and shifted to trading cryptocurrencies in 2016. Leisinger invested in the Ethereum ecosystem and contributed to projects providing liquid staking services. Leisinger explains liquid staking as allowing users to stake assets on the blockchain and mint a receipt token that represents the staked assets, which maintains liquidity while users earn rewards and secure the network.

As institutional investment in cryptocurrency skyrockets, some are looking at ways to add staking to their portfolio. According to Leisinger, most of these firms would naturally choose liquid staking, but hurdles around Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, transparency, tokenholder privileges, and counter-party risks must first be dealt with. Leisinger explains that Alluvial provides a solution for enterprises by dealing with these hurdles that slow down adoption.

On regulations, Leisinger says that firms like Alluvial “really want” regulatory clarity. According to him, there are two types of staking: direct staking and actively managed staking. Both have different implications from a regulatory perspective around token ownership, security and transparency. Leisinger believes liquid staking is better positioned to withstand regulatory pressure due to its transparency.

What’s more, Leisinger admits that a lack of regulatory clarity has had a chilling effect on institutional staking. Nevertheless, the Alluvial exec is optimistic that new milestones like the Ethereum Shapella upgrade will derisk participation in staking and attract interest.

UK reviews AI development: It can ‘drive substantial economic growth’

The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it would examine AI’s development, deployment and social impact.

The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has turned its attention to artificial intelligence (AI) after announcing an examination of the impact of the technology on consumers and the economy.

On May 4, the regulator said it would be looking at the development and deployment of foundation models — applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT — against key principles. Those include safety, transparency, fairness and accountability, among others. 

Our goal is to help this new, rapidly scaling technology develop in ways that ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.

— Competition & Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) May 4, 2023

Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, commented that since AI tools “burst” into the public sphere, regulators have had their eye on it.

“It’s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth.“

She continued by deeming it “crucial” that businesses and consumers in the U.K. have access to the potential benefits of AI technologies while being shielded from fake information. AI-generated fakes have already started populating the web, resulting in lawsuits. 

The initial review will examine the competitive market for AI foundation models and their usage. Regulators plan to monitor how they can expand and present opportunities, along with risks to competition and consumers.

The CMA says its goal is to help the technology develop in ways that “ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.“

Related: UK government targets fraudsters with new ban on cold calls for crypto

Additionally, the review is intended to produce “guiding principles” for the protection of consumers and support healthy competition as the technologies develop. A report on the findings is scheduled to be published in September 2023.

This announcement follows the publication of a white paper on AI from the U.K. government in March 2023.

On April 25, the U.K. prime minister and technology secretary revealed funding of 100 million British pounds ($124.8 million) to support a task force to accelerate the country’s AI readiness.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has launched its native algorithmic United States dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum mainnet — minting more than $22 million worth of the crvUSD token so far.

According to data from blockchain explorer Etherscan, at time of writing on May 4, the contract had minted more than $22 million worth of crvUSD in the past eight hours, with $20 million of that amount minted within the first five minutes.

The deployment of crvUSD on the Ethereum network is a significant step toward the public release of the algorithmic stablecoin. Notably, the stablecoin remains inaccessible to general users, pending integration with Curve’s front-end user interface on its official website.

Responding to a query in the official Curve Finance Telegram chat about when users could expect to see the stablecoin released to the public, an admin claimed it would be coming “soon.”

At the time of publication, Curve Finance is one of the largest DeFi protocols in the industry, with roughly $4.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from DeFiLlama.

Algorithmic stablecoins became the focal point of industry-wide criticism following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, when the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its peg and the value of its sister token Terra — later renamed Terra Classic (LUNC) — plunged by more than 99%. UST’s value was maintained by a complex arbitrage mechanism that was eventually brought down by a group of sophisticated traders. 

Curve’s crvUSD differs from the now-defunct UST, utilizing a similar design similar to MakerDAO’s 

MKR

 stablecoin. According to the crvUSD whitepaper, crvUSD will function as a “collateralized-debt-position” stablecoin, meaning that users must deposit collateral in order to take out a loan in crvUSD. The preferred asset for use as collateral has not yet been specified by Curve Finance.

Curve isn’t the only DeFi protocol with its sights set on bringing an algorithmic stablecoin to market. Competitor protocol Aave (AAVE) released a testnet version of its “native decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin,” dubbed GHO, this past February.

Curve’s plan to release an algorithmic stablecoin was first announced by Curve Team member mrblocktw in a tweet on July 21, 2022.

Later the same day, Curve’s founder, Michael Egorov confirmed that the stablecoin would be overcollateralized at the ReDeFine Tomorrow Web3 summit.

Following the launch of the new stablecoin, the protocol’s native Curve DAO (CRV) token spiked approximately 7% according to data from TradingView. CRV is currently changings hands for $0.96.

Securities token platform INX has launched a wallet with compliance features for institutions, according to a May 3 announcement. The new wallet was created in partnership with wallet infrastructure provider BitGo and uses multi-party computation (MPC) technology.

INX securities tokens exist on the Ethereum network and follow the ERC-1404 token standard. The standard was created in 2018 to allow for compliance-friendly Ethereum tokens. These tokens can only be transferred between users that have passed identity verification with a participating institution.

The new wallet allows institutions to comply with cybersecurity and custody standards in the financial industry when holding INX securities tokens. No single person is given access to the private key that controls a given account. Instead, the key is split into three or more “shards” that have to be combined to sign transactions, which is part of the MPC technology.

According to the announcement, the wallet also contains features to make employee access privileges easier to manage. Companies can task different employees with different roles, such as “viewers, spenders, approvers and administrators.” They can also segregate clients’ assets by splitting up funds into multiple wallets and giving “approver” privileges to each individual client. This allows institutions to give their clients more control over their individual accounts, the announcement said.

Lisa Jowett, head of platform sales at BitGo, said she thinks these new features will help make institutional investors more comfortable using Web3 technology:

“Our wallets can connect to and interact seamlessly with [the INX platform] without compromising on security or reliability. This will unlock new possibilities for investors and serve as a gateway for institutional adoption of Web3.”

INX reached a major milestone on April 3 when it launched its first equity token from a public company, Greenbriar Capital. INX advisor Douglas Borthwick has argued that eventually “all assets will migrate to the blockchain.”

The company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer within the United States. Some industry experts have argued that the U.S. doesn’t have clear enough crypto regulations to allow most crypto exchanges to gain this designation.

Mashinsky files motion to dismiss NY AG suit, says it ‘parrots misinformation’

Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was charged with seven counts of fraud in connection with “false and misleading statements” about his company, among other things.

Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network, has filed a response to New York Attorney General Letitia James’ suit against him. According to the document, the suit has shortcomings in presenting the facts in the case and its legal argument and should be dismissed.

James claims in her suit on behalf of the people of New York state that Mashinsky defrauded over 26,000 New York residents out of billions of dollars, particularly by making false statements about the company’s financial situation.

Mashinsky’s response alleges the suit “parrots misinformation,” shows a lack of understanding of Celsius’ business and cherry-picks statements from Mashinsky’s 180 weekly YouTube appearances. In addition, the suit allegedly does not consider circumstances beyond Mashinsky’s control — that is, the crypto market downturn.

While Banks are not your friends @Mashinsky is definitely your enemy

— Pete No Stop (@PeteNoStop) April 24, 2023

The response also faults the suit’s application of the Martin Act, New York’s strict “blue sky” securities law and other statutes cited in the case's seven counts. The response states:

“Because the Complaint fails to state a legally-cognizable claim against Mashinsky and is otherwise deficient, it should be dismissed in its entirety.”

James’ suit against Mashinsky was announced Jan. 5 and amended in March. Notably, at least for Mashinsky’s response, the suit does not name Celsius as a defendant, only Mashinsky.

Celsius declared bankruptcy on July  13, 2022 after pausing withdrawals a month prior. Depositors still have not received their money back, although Celsius settled with decentralized finance market makers Compound, Aave and Maker on the eve of its bankruptcy filing.

A court-appointed independent examiner found many issues with the company’s behavior in a report issued in January. Examiner Shoba Pillay said the company paid $1.36 billion more in rewards than it generated in revenue from customer assets between 2018 and June 30, 2022.

An auction of Celsius assets is scheduled for May 3, after a number of delays. Bidders reportedly include Gemini and Coinbase.

PRICE ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

Investors seem to have priced in a 25-basis-points rate hike by the United States Federal Reserve on May 3. Next, they will look for clues on the Fed’s actions for the rest of the year.

Will the Fed maintain its hawkish stance as inflation still remains well above its target range, or will the bank troubles and looming recession make the central bank signal a pause in its rate hikes?

The World Economic Forum's “Chief Economists Outlook” report released on May 1 shows that 80% of the chief economists surveyed believe that central banks have to maintain a delicate balance between “managing inflation and maintaining financial sector stability.” The economists anticipate that the central banks will find it difficult to bring down inflation to their target levels.

In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, cautioned investors that investing in assets “outside of the traditional financial system” is the only way out if they want to preserve their capital.

Could Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

 and altcoins start an up-move after bouncing off key support levels? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern in Bitcoin. Generally, a symmetrical triangle acts as a continuation pattern and the price breaks out in the direction that was prevalent before the formation developed.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, it is better to wait for the price to complete the breakout before waging any new bets because sometimes, the setup behaves as a reversal pattern.

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,642) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If the price continues lower and breaks below the triangle, it will suggest the start of a short-term corrective phase. The BTC/USDT pair may drop to $25,250. This level is likely to witness aggressive buying by the bulls.

Contrarily, if the price bounces off the support line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rise to the resistance line. A break and close above the triangle will open the doors for a potential rally to $32,400.

Ether price analysis

Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 jumped off the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 1, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages and challenge the resistance line. If buyers kick the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $2,131. There is minor resistance at $2,000, but it is likely to be crossed.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will make another attempt to sink the pair below the triangle. If they succeed in their endeavor, the pair may plunge to the pattern target of $1,619.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 remains stuck inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers are trying to guard the support line of the triangle. If they manage to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($326), the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the resistance line. Traders will have to overcome this obstacle to signal the start of a new up-move.

Alternatively, if the price collapses below the triangle, it will suggest that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The pair may then slide to $300 and thereafter extend the fall to the pattern target of $280.

XRP price analysis

The long tail on the May 1 and 2 candlesticks shows that the bulls tried to start a recovery in XRP 

XRP

$0.43

. However, they could not sustain the buying pressure, and the price turned lower on May 3.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to extend the decline to the strong support at $0.43. This remains the key level to watch for in the near term. If this support crumbles, the XRP/USDT pair may drop to $0.36. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.

Instead, if the price turns up from $0.43 and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will signal that bulls are on a comeback. The pair could then rally to the resistance line. If buyers surmount this hurdle, the pair may surge to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis

The bulls held Cardano’s ADA 

ADA

$0.365

 above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($0.38) on May 2, but they failed to overcome the obstacle at the 20-day EMA ($0.39).

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are trying to pounce on this opportunity and close the ADA/USDT pair below the 50-day SMA. There is minor support at $0.37, but if that cracks, the selling could pick up momentum, and the pair may slump to $0.33 and later to $0.30.

The important resistance on the upside is the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Buyers will have to drive the price above this level to signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair can then surge to $0.46.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 is struggling to bounce off the strong support near $0.08, which suggests a lack of demand from the bulls.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.08) is sloping down, and the RSI is below 42, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the support near $0.08 is breached, the DOGE/USDT pair could plummet to the next major support at $0.07.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly push the price above the downtrend line. The pair may then rally to $0.09 and thereafter dash toward the stiff overhead resistance at $0.11.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon’s MATIC 

MATIC

$0.8785

 rebounded off the $0.94 support on May 2, indicating that the bulls are trying to aggressively protect the level.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($1.02) is sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. Sellers will try to stall the recovery at the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the MATIC/USDT pair may turn down and fall to $0.94.

The repeated retest of a support level within a short interval tends to weaken it. If this support gives way, the selling could intensify, and the pair may nosedive to $0.69. Buyers will have to kick the price above the resistance line to invalidate the bearish view.

Solana price analysis

Buyers defended the 50-day SMA ($21.78) on May 2, but they could not propel Solana’s SOL 

SOL

$21

 above the 20-day EMA ($22.26). This shows that the bears are selling on every minor rally.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears have pulled the price below the 50-day SMA. If they sustain the breakdown, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the next strong support at $18.70. The possibility of a bounce off this level remains high. If that happens, the pair may stay range-bound between $18.70 and $27.12 for some more time.

Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The pair could then rally to $24 and later dash to the overhead resistance at $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Polkadot’s DOT 

DOT

$5.34

 slipped below the $5.70 support on May 1, and the bears are trying to build upon this advantage on May 3.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls attempted a recovery on May 2, but the shallow bounce showed a lack of aggressive buying near $5.70. This suggests that the DOT/USDT pair may continue lower and reach the crucial support at $5.15.

Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to start a sustained recovery, they will have to quickly push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair may pick up momentum and rally toward $7.

 is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($89) and the horizontal support at $85. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that bears hold the edge.

If bears tug the price below $85, the selling could intensify, and the LTC/USDT pair may plunge to the strong support at $75. The bulls are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break below it will open the doors for a further drop to $65.

Another possibility is that the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the moving averages. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair may then rise to $96 and above it to $106.

Layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain platform Flare has integrated its application programming interface (API) portal on Google Cloud Marketplace, onboarding a number of significant blockchain APIs to the ecosystem.

The integration of Google Cloud Marketplace will provide high-integrity blockchain data from Flare nodes and connected chain nodes to a large pool of developers and users of the software products and services platform. This includes blockchain APIs for Algorand, BNB Smart Chain, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Flare, Litecoin, Songbird, XRP ledger and future-supported blockchain APIs.

Blockchain APIs are touted to free developers from having to run their own nodes for the respective blockchains they are interacting with. The data supplied powers applications that execute transactions and query the latest state of a blockchain by calling up on-chain data.

Flare highlights blockchain APIs as valuable for building cross-chain applications that query various data sources, including major cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets that use its API portal.

A statement from Flare’s vice president of engineering Josh Edwards highlighted that the provision of blockchain APIs to platforms like Google Cloud Marketplace will play a role in increased Web3 participation:

“It makes it easier for developers to experiment with blockchain technology and its many use cases without being burdened by onerous hardware costs and ongoing maintenance.”

Edwards also suggested that larger organizations and partners making use of Google Cloud Marketplace would potentially experiment with the secure and approved Web3 APIs.

The EVM-based layer 1 aims to extend the utility of blockchain technology by providing data from various chains and Web2 sources, which could climb to over 100 chains that form Flare’s oracle.

Flare’s integration comes just days after Polygon Labs and Google Cloud announced a multiyear partnership for the cloud computing service provider to boost the Ethereum scaling protocol’s tools and infrastructure development.

The deal sees Google Cloud’s framework and developer tools provided to Polygon’s core protocols, aimed at fostering the development of Web3 products and decentralized applications on Polygon.

Google Cloud’s partnership with the ecosystem is expected to advance Polygon’s zero-knowledge development. Testing of Polygon zkEVM’s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud reportedly resulted in faster and cheaper transactions compared to the existing infrastructure available.

A new Cosmos-based blockchain called “Tenet'' will use liquid staking coins from other networks to secure its transactions, potentially allowing the new network to inherit the security of older ones, according to a May 3 announcement from the developers.

The network is currently available as a testnet and will launch a mainnet version as soon as testing is complete. This comes after liquid staking has recently become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol category.

Liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Ankr allow users to stake their coins with a network of validators and receive rewards without having to run their own nodes. These protocols also provide users with tokens called “liquid staking derivatives,” or LSDs, redeemable for the underlying deposits and rewards.

According to the announcement, Tenet will allow users to “restake” these LSDs to earn additional rewards on its network. And it will provide users with tokens that represent the LSDs themselves. The team calls these third-order tokens “liquid liquid staking derivatives,” or LLSDs. LLSDs will be usable in lending apps and decentralized exchanges throughout the Tenet network, the announcement said.

The team expects there to be two core benefits to using LSDs instead of a native coin to secure the network. First, it “ensures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each [layer 1] ecosystem it services.” Second, it should “bring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs.”

 to be restaked on Tenet.

The new network is being developed by former executives of Ankr and Blockdaemon and is advised by members of the Lido, Ankr and OpenAI teams.

Liquid staking protocols have existed since 2020 when Lido was first launched. They grew in popularity in 2022 and early 2023 as the Ethereum network implemented a move to proof-of-stake and began to allow staking withdrawals. On May 1, crypto analytics platform DefiLlama announced that liquid staking had become the top category of DeFi apps when measured by total value locked.

Some experts have argued that liquid staking may grow in the future as a result of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.

On May 2, European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares published its latest “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,” which stated that the digital asset market experienced bearish sentiment for the second consecutive week, resulting in outflows totaling $72 million. The report noted that the bearish sentiment could be attributed to the probability of further interest rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve this week.

According to the report, crypto market funds experienced outflows across all geographies and providers, particularly in Germany and Canada, where outflows reached $40 million and $14 million, respectively.

Bitcoin

 each gaining less than $1 million in capital flows. 

Blockchain equities also experienced negative sentiment, resulting in outflows of $2.5 million last week, although the year-to-date net flows remain positive at $27 million.

CoinShares researcher James Butterfill authored the report. He wrote, ""Volumes remain subdued for the broader crypto market (50% less than year average) while ETP [exchange-traded products] investment product volumes at US$1.7bn for the week are 16% above the year average.""

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX.

According to Hayes, due to the huge amount of public debt accumulated by the world’s largest economies, governments will have no choice other than ""inflating it away"" through money printing. 

Thus, the only way to escape the progressive destruction of fiat wealth is by acquiring assets outside the traditional financial system, such as crypto, the purchasing power of which doesn’t fall compared to the cost of energy. 

“My whole goal with all of my investing is to preserve capital so that I can consume the same amount of energy or whatever energy amount that I would like from now and into the future,” Hayes said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. 

However, the amount of crypto assets available is relatively small compared to the total amount of debt in the economy, which means that only a few will be able to preserve their capital as the majority see their wealth destroyed.

According to Hayes, the crypto crackdown in the United States reflects the government’s attempt to keep the masses within the traditional system by preventing them from fleeing to crypto.

“They want your capital to sit there and they'll make it a very pleasant, pleasant journey to lose 20, 30, 40, 50, 60% of your purchasing power over a period of time such that the debt load is effectively lowered and the finances are healthier,” he said.

The share of Ether held by so-called whale addresses has dropped since Ethereum's Shapella upgrade in mid April, suggesting that large investors may be leaning bearish in the near term.

ETH whale population shrinks post-Shapella

The amount of Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 held by addresses with 1,000-10,000 ETH, or ""whales,"" was over 14.033 million ETH on May 1, according to Glassnode data. In comparison, the count was 14.167 million ETH on April 12, when Shapella went live on Ethereum.

Interestingly, a week before the Shapella upgrade, the Ether whale cohort held 14.303 million ETH, the highest amount in 2023.

""Shrimps"" only ones buying ETH since Shapella

Ether's price is down over 3.5% since the Shapella upgrade — suggesting that several whales may have indeed ""sold the news.""

Interestingly, other address cohorts also showed a decline, including sharks (100-1,000 ETH), fishes (10-100 ETH), crabs (1-10 ETH) and even mega-whales (10,000+ ETH).

Only shrimps (<1 ETH) accumulated during the period, with their net position slightly increasing from 1.79 million ETH on April 12 to 1.80 million ETH on May 1.

Shapella enabled investors to withdraw ETH locked via staking, which some argued would increase selling pressure.

Since the Shapella upgrade, investors have withdrawn over 1.97 million ETH worth around $3.6 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. Nevertheless, no major changes in cryptocurrency exchanges' ETH balances have been seen to date. 

Ether whales vs. shrimps

Historically, fewer Ether whales typically means heightened downside risk for the ETH price.

Whale activity typically acts as a leading market indicator. So, rich investors accumulating typically precedes a price rise and vice versa. 

The price-to-whale positive correlation existed until March 2020, as shown in the chart below. Afterward, retail mania took over alongside the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, and the correlation snapped.

Notably, ETH rallied from $110 in March 2020 to over $4,950 in November 2021 despite the declining number of whales. The inverse correlation continued throughout the price downtrend to around $850 in June 2022.

But since then, whale holdings have risen by nearly 1 million ETH. Meanwhile, ETH's price has more than doubled to around $1,850, hinting at a possible return of the price-to-whale correlation, which would be a bullish sign for Ether. 

Where can the ETH price go next?

The $2,000 level is an important psychological resistance level for ETH/USD that bulls have been unable to break despite multiple attempts in 2023.

Related: Ethereum price outlook weakens, but ETH derivatives suggest $1.6K is unlikely

On the daily chart, ETH/USD holds above the short-term support provided by its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), near $1,840. A successful rebound from here opens $2,000-$2,125 as the next upside target range in the second quarter.

Conversely, a break below the 50-day EMA risks sending ETH toward its 200-day EMA near $1,670, down about 10% from current price levels.

Ether’s (ETH) price has shown weakness after failing to break above the $1,950 resistance on April 26. The subsequent correction drove ETH to $1,810 on May 1, nearing its lowest level in four weeks. Curiously, the movement happened while First Republic Bank (FRB) was seized by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with JPMorgan to protect FRB depositors, estimating a $13 billion loss.

Commented on the latest major U.S. bank failure, UBS analyst Erika Najarian stated:

“This deal does not change the rates, recession and regulatory headwinds that regional banks are facing.“
ETH price ignores banking crisis

Curiously, the VIX indicator, which measures how traders are pricing the risks of extreme price oscillations for the S&P 500 index, reached its lowest level in 18 months at 15.6% on May 1.

It is worth noting that overconfidence is the main driver for surprise moves and large liquidations in derivatives markets, meaning low volatility does not necessarily precede periods of price stability.

The economic environment has worsened significantly after the U.S. reported first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.1%, below the 2% market consensus. Meanwhile, inflation in Germany remained exceptionally high at 7.6% year-over-year in April. Investors are now pricing higher odds of a global recession as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates above 5% on May 3.

According to macro analyst Lyn Alden, the U.S. Treasury is now targeting $1.4 trillion in new net borrowing between April and September 2023 as tax receipts have been running below expectations.

If the U.S. debt level continues to increase while interest rates remain high, the government will be forced to increase debt payments, further pressuring its delicate fiscal situation. Such a situation should be favorable for scarce assets, but what can Ethereum derivatives metrics tell us about professional traders’ risk appetite? Let’s take a look. 

Ethereum derivatives display modest confidence

Ether quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, and they typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period.

As a result, futures contracts on healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango — which is not unique to crypto markets.

Since April 19, the Ether futures premium has been stuck near 2%, indicating that professional traders are unwilling to flip neutral despite ETH’s price testing $1,950 resistance on April 26.

The absence of demand for leverage longs does not always imply a price decline. As a result, traders should investigate Ether’s options markets to learn how whales and market makers value the likelihood of future price movements.

The 25% delta skew indicates when market makers and arbitrage desks overcharge for upside or downside protection.

In bear markets, options traders increase their odds of a price drop, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. Bullish markets, on the other hand, tend to drive the skew metric below 8%, indicating that bearish put options are in less demand.

Ether 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas

The 25% skew ratio is currently at 1 as protective put options are trading in line with the neutral-to-bullish calls. That’s a bullish indicator given the six-day 7.8% correction since ETH’s price failed to break the $1,950 resistance.

So far, Ether’s price has failed to display strength, while the baking sector created a giant opportunity for decentralized financial systems to showcase their transparency and resilience versus traditional markets. On the other hand, derivatives metrics show no sign of extreme fear or leveraged bearish bets, indicating low odds of retesting the $1,600 support in the near term.

Liquid staking solutions such as Lido and Rocket Pool now have more total value locked (TVL) than decentralized exchanges (DEXs), making them the top category of DeFi protocols, according to data from crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

TVL is a metric that measures the dollar value of all cryptocurrencies locked within a protocol’s smart contracts.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, there was only $17.19 billion of crypto locked in liquid staking contracts, compared to $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion, giving them the top spot.

Related: Podcaster apologizes for spreading Lido rumor

Liquid staking protocols are staking pools that stake crypto on behalf of users. These protocols also issue tokens to users that represent the person's deposited crypto. Because these tokens can be used in DeFi apps, liquid staking protocols allow users to both simultaneously stake their coins and use them in other applications.

According to DefiLlama’s May 1 data, Lido (stETH) is still the top staking protocol with $11.54 billion of cryptocurrency locked inside its contracts. Coinbase Wrapped Staked Ether (CBETH) is a distant second with $2.19 billion locked, and Rocket Pool (rETH) is third with $1.46 billion. The remaining protocols have less than $1 billion of TVL each but add up to $2.22 billion collectively.

Lido was the first liquid staking protocol, and it launched in 2020. Liquid staking has become more popular as Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake and allowed withdrawals.

The recovery in Bitcoin is facing a stiff hurdle above $30,000, indicating that the bulls are wary of buying at higher levels. That could be because of the upcoming Fed meeting on May 2 and 3, which is known to cause an increase in short-term volatility.

What are the levels that the bulls need to defend on Bitcoin and select altcoins if they want to keep the chances alive for the continuation of the up move? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

The bears are expected to mount a strong defense in the zone between 4,200 and 4,325. If the price turns down from the overhead zone but does not fall below the moving averages, it would suggest that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying the dips.

That would increase the likelihood of a break above 4,325. If that happens, the index could accelerate toward 4,500 and then 4,650.

If bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to quickly yank the price below the 50-day SMA. That could sink the index to the uptrend line.

U.S. dollar index price analysis

After trading between the 100.82 support and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of 101.93 for the past few days, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) is trying to break out of the range.

The relative strength index (RSI) has been gradually rising toward the center, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the index could rally to the 50-day SMA (103.05).

Such a move would suggest that the index may extend its stay inside the 100.82 to 106 range for a few more days.

If bears want to strengthen their position further, they will have to tug the price below 100.82. That would complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, starting a possible downtrend toward 97.50.

Bitcoin price analysis

The long wick on Bitcoin’s April 30 candlestick chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $30,000.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price turned down and slumped on May 1 but a minor positive is that the bulls are fiercely protecting the 50-day SMA ($28,146). This suggests that the BTC/USDT pair may swing between $26,942 and $30,000 for a while.

Usually, a tight range of trading is followed by a range expansion. If the price continues lower and plunges below $26,942, the pair may decline to the crucial support level of $25,250.

On the contrary, if the range expands above $30,000, the pair is likely to rise to $31,000 and thereafter to $32,400. A break above this level would signal a pickup in momentum.

Ethereum price analysis

The bulls are struggling to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,896), indicating that the bears are trying to flip this level into resistance.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA has started to turn down gradually and the RSI has dipped below 45, indicating that bears have a slight edge. If bears sink the price and keep it below $1,785, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,663.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to propel the pair above the psychological level of $2,000. If they succeed, the pair can rally to the stiff overhead resistance level of $2,200.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($323) on April 30, indicating that the bulls continue to guard this level with full force.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the buyers and sellers. The 20-day EMA ($328) is sloping up gradually and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.

If buyers drive the price above the triangle, it would signal the start of a new up move. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to the pattern target of $380 and subsequently to $400.

The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the pair below the support line of the triangle and deepen the correction to $280.

XRP price analysis

XRP’s 

XRP

$0.43

 recovery hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($0.47) on April 29, which suggests that the sentiment is negative and traders are selling on rallies.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to pull the price to the strong support level of $0.43. This is an important level to keep an eye on because if it cracks, the XRP/USDT pair may collapse to the next major support level of $0.36.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. Such a move would suggest that the bears are losing their grip. That could open the doors for a possible rally to the resistance line. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could surge toward $0.56.

Cardano price analysis

Buyers are finding it difficult to push Cardano 

ADA

$0.365

 above the neckline, indicating that the bears are fiercely protecting the level.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slip below the 50-day SMA ($0.38). The RSI is in negative territory and the 20-day EMA ($0.40) is flattening out, indicating that bears are trying to gain the upper hand.

If the ADA price plunges below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to the next support level of $0.33.

On the upside, the bulls will have to cross the obstacle at the neckline to set up a retest of $0.46. A break above this level would signal the start of a new uptrend.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8785

 is facing selling by the bears on relief rallies while the bulls are trying to defend support at $0.94.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

This tight trading range is unlikely to continue for long. The down-sloping 20-day EMA ($1.03) and the RSI in negative territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears tug the price below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair could nosedive toward $0.69.

On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it would suggest the start of a stronger recovery. The pair may then rise to the resistance line, where the bulls will again face stiff pressure from the bears.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.08) on April 30, indicating that the sentiment is negative and bears are using the rallies to sell.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price has reached support near $0.08. If this level gives way, it would suggest that bears have seized control. Sellers would then try to build upon their advantage and pull the DOGE/USDT pair to the next support level at $0.07. The bulls are expected to defend the zone between $0.07 and $0.06 with all their might.

Contrarily, if the price bounces off the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, it would suggest that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. The upside momentum could pick up after buyers pierce the downtrend line. Dogecoin's price may then climb to $0.11.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 turned down from $24 on April 30, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. The price has reached the 50-day SMA ($21.74), which is an important level to keep an eye on.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The short-term advantage would tilt in favor of the bears if they manage to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. The SOL/USDT pair could then slump to the strong support level of $18.70. Buyers are likely to guard this level with force. If the price rebounds off $18.70, the bulls would again try to clear the hurdle at $24.

If they can pull it off, the pair could attempt a rally to $27.12. A downturn from this level may result in rangebound price action between $27.12 and $18.70 for some time. Alternatively, if the bulls catapult the price above $27.12, the next stop could be as high as $39.

Layer-2 blockchain protocols have been in the spotlight in 2023, bringing major performance improvements to a variety of platforms and services operating in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been key in the roll-out of a variety of layer 2s, with the technology pioneered by the decentralized scaling network Starknet. StarkWare, the technology firm behind the scaling platform, has outlined plans to further improve its layer-2 network to meet an expected increase in users and developers through the rest of the year.

Cointelegraph caught up with Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder of StarkWare, to unpack key points set out in a 2023 roadmap for Starknet. Chief among a list of to-dos is performance improvements that are centered around higher throughput and reduced latency of Starknet’s network.

Ben-Sasson highlighted the focus on performance upgrades that are expected to deliver significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) than on Ethereum’s mainnet at lower gas costs:

“The most important thing is for builders and developers to have high throughput so that they can really build. Starknet is about increasing the computational abilities of Ethereum and we just want to provide this raw power to the hands of developers.”

Starknet v0.12.0 is expected to be released in the next month and is the culmination of a six-month sprint that involves transitioning Starknet’s development stack to a Rust-based Sequencer as well as an open-source project that has built a Rust-Cairo virtual machine.

StarkWare open-sourced its programming language compiler Cairo early in 2023, with the language aimed at driving the development of ZK-rollup and validity-proof-powered decentralized applications (DApps).

Ben-Sasson added that Starknet continues to chase an ambitious target of processing at least 10 times the throughput of Ethereum at a tenth of the cost. He highlighted StarkEx’s ability to deliver significant TPS on the decentralized exchange dYdX. StarkEx is another layer-2 scaling engine developed by StarkWare.

At times, dYdX processes up to 54 transactions per second, while the average TPS of Ethereum is around 10–12. Ben-Sasson also noted that these dYdX transactions are roughly four to five times larger than those on Ethereum, which bodes well for the improved scaling capabilities of Starknet in the near future:

“We’re often experiencing practical TPS or gas usage that is orders of magnitude greater than what Ethereum can deal with. I’m very confident that this will also be replicated on Starknet.”

Performance improvements have been prioritized as a result of developer and user feedback highlighting delays in transaction processing on Starknet. The next port of call is the reduction of transaction costs, which will be addressed by targeting the cost of storing data on Ethereum’s mainnet.

“We’re going to roll out Volition, which allows users to opt as to whether they want their data on or off-chain and this will be part of the base layer of the Starknet system.”

Ben-Sasson said the release of off-chain data availability will complement Ethereum’s in-development improvement proposal “Proto-Danksharding” Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will introduce a new type of transaction that carries binary large objects or “blobs.” The EIP fundamentally aims to provide cheaper transactions.

Starknet is also aiming to deliver faster finality further down the 2023 roadmap, which will produce shorter and fixed interval block times on the network. This will be carried out with the introduction of a fee market to prioritize Starknet’s network resources on users’ willingness to pay for transactions, inspired by conventional market systems:

“Market mechanisms are a very good way to solve this. Blockchain didn’t invent this — blockchains adopted this from just the conventional world. That’s how you prioritize resources and allow users to signal this.”

A number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols have begun rolling out ZK-rollups to further improve efforts to provide faster and cheaper transactions to the smart contract blockchain network. This includes the likes of Polygon and ConsenSys.

"What is Immutable, explained","Explore Immutable, the leading Web3 game development platform to build and scale Web3 games.","1.
What is Immutable, and why is it important for blockchain gaming?

Immutable is a game development platform that simplifies building Web3 games on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Headquartered in Sydney and co-founded in 2018 by James Ferguson, Robbie Ferguson and Alex Connolly, this leading Web3 gaming platform is focused on a mission to bring digital ownership to players by making it easy to build Web3 games for mainstream adoption. Immutable is funded and backed by prominent crypto VC funds and transformational tech investors like Bitkraft Ventures, King River Capital, AirTree, Temasek, Coinbase and more. 

The Immutable platform empowers gaming studios and developers with a powerful suite of products, delivering clear solutions that amplify their capabilities and transform the way they create, launch and distribute games. 

Its pre-built solutions designed for ease of use enable developers to launch their games faster without compromising on either security or the gaming experience, thereby solving two major blockchain gaming industry-wide issues. Additionally, builders receive Web3 guidance, live support for their communities and access to Immutable’s extensive gaming ecosystem.

Immutable has also been at the forefront of enabling zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solutions for Ethereum and offers multiple ZK-based scaling options, including Immutable X, a rollup based on StarkWare technology, and Immutable zkEVM, powered by Polygon. 

Immutable Games, its own gaming studio, is a global player in Web3 game development and pioneered the world’s first blockbuster nonfungible token (NFT) trading-card game Gods Unchained. It is currently building the highly anticipated mobile role-playing game (RPG) Guild of Guardians while also partnering with third-party game developers on games such as MetalCore, Infinite Victory and Shardbound.

2.
How does Immutable work, and what problem does it solve?

Immutable is a complete end-to-end development platform for building and scaling Web3 games on Ethereum, with industry-leading security and frictionless developer and gaming experiences. 

Immutable use zero-knowledge Rollups (ZK-rollups) to achieve layer-2 scalability. ZK-rollups fuse an array of hundreds of transactions off-chain and then send them to Ethereum as a single transaction, allowing faster validation of transactions and thereby ensuring gas fees are kept to a minimum.

In March 2023, Immutable announced its second scaling solution, Immutable zkEVM, for games alongside the existing Immutable X, a ZK-rollup powered by StarkWare. Set to fully launch later in 2023, this new EVM-compatible ZK-rollup will be powered by Polygon technology with full Immutable platform support to help make Web3 games faster, straightforward to develop and less risky from development to launch. 

The partnership between Immutable and Polygon, along with the creation of Immutable zkEVM, solves many problems for Web3 game development. Here’s how:

One-stop gaming solution: Immutable’s platform with zkEVM tech offers Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, low cost, massive scale and Ethereum security all while providing direct integration into Immutable’s full-stack gaming platform. This provides developers with a suite of solutions needed to succeed. 
Network effects: Developers can access the combined network of Immutable and Polygon to get access to gamers, tools and funding.
Reduced development costs: For existing games, the opportunity to migrate existing smart contracts to the Immutable zkEVM environment is provided via Immutable’s smart contract templates. 
Enhanced gameplay mechanics: From staking and crafting to advanced functionalities, including dynamic NFTs that equip other NFTs are possible with Immutable zkEVM.
Seamless interoperability: With Immutable zkEVM, game developers can create games that are seamlessly interoperable with other games or platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling broader access and economies of scale.
Secure gaming environment: Immutable’s quality control measures are designed to protect gaming studios and users from malicious activity, poorly designed contracts or validators, and conserve the chain’s bandwidth for gaming-specific activities.
3.
What are the key features of Immutable?

Immutable aims to provide a fast, secure and cost-effective solution for decentralized applications (DApps) while solving numerous issues around scalability and gaming. 

The key features and technologies of the Immutable platform include:

Enterprise-grade security with massive scalability

The integration of zero-knowledge proofs into the Immutable platform allows for a substantial decrease in transaction costs and an increase in the number of transactions per second (TPS) compared to traditional Ethereum platforms. At the same time, the technology guarantees the confidentiality of sensitive information while permitting the verification of statements.

The largest ecosystem in Web3 gaming 

Immutable offers access to a growing ecosystem of over 1 million players and $2 billion in investor funding for games building on Immutable, along with over 150 well-known titles that have selected Immutable as their gaming platform.

Frictionless user experiences

The full suite of Immutable products and vetted smart contract templates have been created specifically to reduce onboarding complexities, generate native gameplay experiences, and empower game studios with the tools they need to provide delightful Web3 experiences to their communities.

Game-centric development platform

Immutable has five years of experience building and scaling some of the promising Web3 games, such as Illuvium, Gods Unchained and Guild of Guardians. Drawing from this, it has used that expertise to ensure game developers have a one-stop-shop platform containing everything they need to achieve mainstream adoption.

4.
What are IMX and Immutable Marketplace?

Immutable uses a decentralized governance system via IMX as the native utility token on the Immutable platform.

The IMX token is an ERC-20 token with a total token supply of 2 billion. Incentives among traders, creators and markets are balanced by the IMX token, ensuring rewards go to pro-network activities on Immutable. The Immutable white paper describes three core uses of IMX: fees, staking and governance. 

Immutable has its own marketplace as the default home for trading NFTs on the protocol. The Immutable Marketplace supports Ethereum wallets without the need to switch networks. NFTs are free to mint for users on the Immutable Marketplace, and since there is only a 2% sell-on fee, it is a low-cost avenue for launching new collections with near-zero gas fees.

Apart from its own marketplace, Immutable’s Orderbook and Marketplace Network facilitates partnerships with 10 leading NFT marketplaces, such as GameStop, Token Trove, OKK, etc. Thanks to the power of the orderbook, games and marketplaces building on the Immutable platform experience doubled liquidity as evidenced by the fact that half of all trades on Immutable are filled on non-origin marketplaces.

In November 2022, Immutable partnered with GameStop, the leading global video game retailer, to integrate its global orderbook into the GameStop NFT marketplace. This will bring current and upcoming projects on Immutable to GameStop, including Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Ember Sword, Playco, GreenPark Sports, Illuvium and many others. 

5.
What are the DApps on Immutable?

The majority of DApps on Immutable fall under the category of Gaming and Collectibles.

Several games are currently being built on the Immutable platform ranging from RPGs to sci-fi exploration, and autobattlers to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). Some of these include:

Illuvium: Illuvium is a decentralized game studio building an open-world RPG adventure game. Players are immersed in a unique combination of sci-fi and fantasy while capturing Iluvials, creatures inhabiting the world of Illuvium. 
Gods Unchained: Released in 2018, Gods Unchained is a leading Web3 play-to-earn trading card game that has already seen over 52 million cards exchanged. Despite being in beta, the game has over 450,000 registered users. 
Guilds of Guardians: Guild of Guardians is a multiplayer action RPG developed by Mineloader and published by Immutable Games. While the game is yet to be launched in 2023, over 1 million players have pre-registered for the game.
Immortal Game: Immortal Game is building chess on the blockchain, enhancing the classic game by introducing a crypto layer that enables players to own stylish NFTs tied to pieces called Immortals.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-immutable-explained"

A Coinbase executive claims to have discovered a “jailbreak” for the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT that allows it to calculate the probability of bizarre crypto price scenarios.

The crypto exchange’s head of business operations Conor Grogan, an avid ChatGPT user, shared a screenshot of the results in an April 30 tweet — showing that ChatGPT states there be a 15% chance that Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

 will “fade to irrelevancy” with prices falling over 99.99% by 2035.

Meanwhile, the chatbot assigned a 20% chance of Ether

ChatGPT was even less confident about Litecoin 

LTC

$80.33

 and Dogecoin 

DOGE

, however, attributing probabilities of 35% and 45% respectively for the coins to go to near zero.

The Coinbase executive concluded that ChatGPT is “generally” a “big fan” of Bitcoin but remains “more skeptical” when it comes to altcoins.

Prior to the cryptocurrency predictions, Grogan asked ChatGPT to assign odds to several political predictions involving Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Other predictions were aimed towards the impact of AI on humanity, religion and the existence of aliens.

“Aliens have visited Earth and are being covered up by the government,” reads one wild prediction — to which ChatGPT assigned a 10% probability.

The executive also shared a script of the prompt, which he then fed to ChatGPT to build the tables.

Grogan backed up the preciseness of the results by claiming to have tested out the prompt over 100 times:

“I ran this prompt 100 times on a wiped memory GPT 3.5 and 4 and GPT would return very consistent numbers; standard deviation was

It isn’t the first time the executive experimented with crypto-related issues using ChatGPT.

On March 15, Grogan showed that GPT-4 — the latest iteration of ChatGPT — could spot security vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts and provide an outline to exploit faulty contracts.

Studies carried out by OpenAI — the team behind ChatGPT — have shown GPT-4 to pass high school tests and law school exams with scores ranking in the 90th percentile.

Meanwhile, Italy recently lifted a ban on the AI tool after banning it for one month following a series of privacy concerns that were raised to Italian regulators.

The cryptocurrency market witnessed sharp volatility on April 26 on rumors that large sums of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

 were on the move from the wallets linked to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox and the United States government. A minor positive is that Bitcoin and select altcoins held their respective support levels.

After Bitcoin’s sharp rally in 2023, some traders seem to be planning to book profits. Coinglass reported that the Bitcoin balance held at Binance soared by 50,000 Bitcoin in the past 30 days.

While this could add to short-term pressure, bulls can take solace because the increase is not identical across exchanges. Coinglass said that the aggregate increase of Bitcoin balance across exchanges was 14,000 Bitcoin.

The next major event for the market is likely to be the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting on May 2 and 3. The FedWatch Tool projects a 90% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike at the meeting. Most analysts expect this to be the final rate hike before a pivot later in the year.

Could Bitcoin and select altcoins break above their respective resistance levels and resume the up-move? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin formed a long-legged doji candlestick pattern on April 26, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. This uncertainty resolved to the upside with a close above the 20-day exponential moving average ($28,619) on April 27.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA while the bulls will attempt to flip the level into support. If buyers succeed, the BTC/USDT pair will try to challenge the overhead resistance zone between $31,000 and $32,400. This zone is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment is turning negative and traders are selling on rallies. The pair may then retest the strong support at the 50-day simple moving average ($27,657). A break and close below this level could open the gates for a decline to $25,250.

ETH price analysis

The bulls kicked Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 above the 20-day EMA ($1,905) on April 26 and 27 but they could not reach the psychological level of $2,000. This suggests that the bears are trying to halt the recovery below $2,000.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This points to a possible range-bound action between $2,000 and $1,785 for a few days.

If that happens, it will be a positive sign because it will indicate that the bulls are not rushing to book profits. That will enhance the prospects for a potential rally to $2,200. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below $1,785. The ETH/USDT pair could then collapse to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,663.

BNB price analysis

The bulls propelled BNB 

BNB

$314

 above the $338 overhead resistance on April 26 but they could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls again tried to overcome the obstacle at $338 on April 27 but the bears did not budge. The selling picked up momentum on April 28 and the bears are trying to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($321). If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could dive to $300 and thereafter to $280.

Instead, if the price rebounds off the current level, it will indicate that bulls have not given up and are buying on dips. The bulls will have to surmount the hurdle at $350 to signal the start of a new uptrend toward $400.

XRP price analysis

XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 bounced off the support at $0.43 on April 26, indicating that the bulls are fiercely guarding this level.

The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.48), which is an important level for the bears to defend in the near term. If the price turns down from this level, the sellers will again try to yank the price below $0.43. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair may plunge to $0.36.

Contrarily, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair can reach the resistance line. A break and close above this level will suggest that the short-term corrective phase is over. The pair will then attempt a rally to $0.54 and subsequently to $0.58.

Cardano 

ADA

$0.365

 rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($0.38) on April 25 and 26, indicating that buyers are trying to start a recovery from this support.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ADA/USDT pair has reached the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern where the bears are trying to halt the recovery. If buyers overpower the sellers and sustain the price above the neckline, the pair should rally to $0.46.

Conversely, if the price turns down from the neckline, it will suggest that the bears are trying to prevent the reversal pattern from forming. The sellers will then make another attempt to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. If they can pull it off, the pair could dump to $0.34.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bears pulled Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 below the support near $0.08 on April 26 but they failed to build upon the breakdown. Buyers purchased the dip and pushed the price back above the 50-day SMA ($0.08) on April 27.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The next resistance to watch out for is the 20-day EMA ($0.08) and then the downtrend line. Buyers will have to propel the price above the downtrend line to clear the path for a possible rally to the $0.10 to $0.11 resistance zone.

Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price back below the support near $0.08. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair may slide to the vital support near $0.07. The bulls are likely to protect this level with all their might.

Polygon price analysis

The long tail on Polygon’s 

MATIC

$0.8785

 April 25 and 26 candlestick shows that the bulls are defending the support at $0.94 with vigor but the bears have not yet given up.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1.05) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have the upper hand. Sellers will try to halt the recovery in the zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line.

If the price turns down from the resistance line, it will signal the formation of a potential descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break below $0.94. If this support cracks, the MATIC/USDT pair risks a plunge to $0.69.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 tried to break out of the tight range trading on April 26 but failed. The bulls are again trying to resolve the uncertainty in their favor on April 28.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price rises above the immediate resistance at $23.18, it will signal that the bulls have absorbed the supply. The SOL/USDT pair will then attempt a rally toward the stiff overhead resistance at $27.12, which remains the key level for the bulls to overcome. If they do that, the pair can start a new up-move and soar to $39.

If bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly tug the price below the $18.70 support. That can sink the pair to the next support at $15.28.

Polkadot price analysis

The bears successfully defended the moving averages on April 26 but could not sustain the drop below the support at $5.70. This indicates that Polkadot 

DOT

$5.34

 is finding buyers at lower levels.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The DOT/USDT pair can swing between $5.70 and the 50-day SMA ($6.20) for some time. If the consolidation resolves to the downside, the selling could intensify and the pair may fall to $5.15. This level is likely to attract buyers.

Alternatively, if buyers drive the price above the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bulls are on a comeback. The pair may first climb to $7 and if this resistance is scaled, the rally could stretch to $7.90.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.33

 witnessed a hugely volatile day on April 26, indicating that the bulls and the bears tried to gain complete control but failed.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, large volatile days are followed by a range contraction for a few days. The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the near term. The LTC/USDT pair may oscillate between $85 and $96 for some time.

A break above $96 or below $85 will start the next leg of the trending move. If bears sink the price below $85, the pair may plummet to $75. On the other hand, a rally above $96 may open the gates for a possible rally to $106.

Polygon’s core protocols, including Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS), Polygon zkEVM and Polygon Supernets, are set to benefit from the provision of Google Cloud’s framework and developer tools. The partnership is aimed at simplifying developer integration to build, launch and grow Web3 products and decentralized applications (DApps) on Polygon.

Google Cloud’s partnership with the ecosystem is expected to advance Polygon’s zero-knowledge development. Testing of Polygon zkEVM’s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud reportedly resulted in faster and cheaper transactions compared to the existing infrastructure available.

The Polygon zkEVM beta, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scaling solution, was launched to mainnet in March 2023, powering reduced transaction costs and increased throughput of smart contract deployments.

Google Cloud’s Blockchain Node Engine will be used by the Polygon ecosystem to assist with time-intensive processes and costly overheads of acquiring, maintaining and operating dedicated blockchain nodes. This specific integration intends to remove the need for Polygon developers to configure and run Polygon PoS nodes.

Polygon Labs president Ryan Wyatt highlighted the wide variety of benefits to the protocol’s ecosystem through the partnership in a statement coinciding with the rollout of the collaboration:

“Today’s announcement with Google Cloud aims to increase transaction throughput enabling use cases in gaming, supply chain management, and DeFi.”

Google Cloud’s APAC managing director of engineering and Web3 go-to-market, Mitesh Agarwal, said its services are improving data availability, resilience and performance of scaling protocols like ZK-proofs.

The partnership will also provide capital resources to Polygon ecosystem developers and companies building Web3 products and DApps. Certain early-stage Polygon Ventures-backed startups will also be able to receive newly launched Web3-specific benefits from the Google for Startups Cloud Program.

Google Cloud’s startup accelerator program now supports 11 major blockchain firms. Meanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Nansen also announced that its data services would be available to projects in Google Cloud’s Web3 startup program.

As cryptocurrencies increasingly fall under the purview of global tax authorities, fintech Revolut has integrated an automated tax reporting service for its users.

The digital financial services provider has partnered with cryptocurrency tax solution Koinly to allow users to generate cryptocurrency tax reports to work out gains and losses. Revolut users will be able to synchronize their cryptocurrency transaction history with Koinly to expedite tax calculations.

Koinly’s global head of partnerships Jane McEvoy tells Cointelegraph that the partnership has been a work in progress since the start of 2023. The service works with more that 50 different partners around the world, which has enabled the company to cater to a wide range of users with different cryptocurrency tax preferences and requirements.

Koinly’s head of tax Danny Talwar added that the use of crypto tax software is becoming increasingly popular as tax authorities around the world hone in on the sector.

“Many crypto traders have multiple exchanges and wallets, meaning keeping tax records are a nightmare. With strict and onerous record keeping requirements globally, crypto tax software saves time and automates tax reporting.”

Talwar previously highlighted the importance of cryptocurrency tax services in helping citizens in the United States take advantage of “tax loss harvesting.“ Speaking to Cointelegraph ahead of the U.S. tax deadline in April 2023, Talwar said taxpayers would do well to take advantage of depressed cryptocurrency markets to reduce their tax liabilities.

Revolut serves over 28 million users across several jurisdictions worldwide following the acquisition of a banking license in Lithuania in late 2018. The digital bank has been offering cryptocurrency custody services since December 2017.

The fintech firm has since expanded its services around the world in conjunction with regulatory compliance processes in various countries. This includes receiving a green light from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority in September 2022 to offer cryptocurrency products and services in the country.

The Ether price has held above $1,820 for the past three weeks, despite facing a 13.7% correction between April 18-21. Still, analyzing a broader time frame provides a more constructive view, as Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 has gained 20.8% in three months while the S&P 500 stock market index has stood flat. However, according to ETH options and futures metrics, the gains have not been enough to make professional investors bullish.

Worsening macroeconomic conditions have driven cryptocurrencies’ positive momentum in 2023, including the ongoing banking crisis. According to Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, if the government refuses to bail out First Republic Bank, it could set off a dangerous chain reaction of insolvencies.

Recession risks increased after the United States economy grew at a modest 1.1% annualized pace in the first quarter, well below the 2% expected. Meanwhile, inflation continues to hurt the economy, as the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 4.2% in the first quarter.

Driving the bearishness from whales and market makers is the diminishing total value locked (TVL) and average transaction fees above $4 since February on the Ethereum network. According to DefiLlama data, Ethereum decentralized applications reached 15.3 million ETH in TVL on April 24. That compares with 22.0 million ETH six months prior, a 30% decline.

Ether’s inability to break above $2,000 could also reflect traders anticipating the Federal Reserve raising interest rates again on May 3. Higher interest rates make fixed-income investments more attractive, while businesses and families face additional costs to refinance their debts, creating a bearish environment for risk assets, including ETH.

Ether futures show lack of buying appetite

Ether quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.

As a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.

Ether traders have been cautious in the past few weeks, and even with the recent breakout above $2,100 on April 14, there has been no surge in demand for leveraged longs.

Furthermore, the Ether futures premium has worsened from its recent peak of 4.7% on April 1 to its current 1.8% level. This suggests that buyers are avoiding leveraged longs and there is a moderate demand for short (bear) positions using futures contracts.

Ether options traders flirted with bearishness

Traders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.

In short, if traders anticipate an Ether price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.

Ether 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas

Currently, the options delta 25% skew is neutral between protective puts and neutral-to-bullish call options. However, between April 24-26, the indicator briefly sustained levels above 7%, as traders feared a sharp price correction was the most likely scenario.

This change indicates a slight increase in confidence, but over the past four weeks, moderate fear has been the prevailing sentiment, according to the 25% options skew.

In essence, Ether options and futures markets suggest that pro traders are less confident than a week prior but not excessively pessimistic. Consequently, if the ETH price breaks above $2,000, it would be a surprise for most, but at the same time, the indicators show no signs of stress.

Wallets have always been a key topic in the cryptocurrency industry because of their essential role in adoption. As the crypto world evolves and enters the multichain phase, wallets may need to operate differently. In Episode 16 of Hashing It Out, Phantom Wallet CEO Brandon Millman joins Elisha Owusu Akyaw to discuss how wallets are adapting to the cryptocurrency space’s multichain nature. Millman also shares his thoughts on airdrops for wallet applications, regulations and what a multichain landscape means for adoption.

Before Phantom, Millman had prior experience building decentralized tools. He helped build Matcha.xyz, a decentralized exchange aggregator on Ethereum, and 0x APIs that power other aggregators. According to him, the important role wallets play in onboarding users was what attracted him to building a wallet application.

Phantom started as a Solana-only wallet, as the team believed in its growth trajectory because it “had the right ingredients to be a huge ecosystem.” Millman argued that the bet was not misplaced, as the network witnessed growth in 2021 and 2022 and is holding up despite the bear season.

Nonetheless, Millman pointed out that the ecosystem is evolving, and wallet applications need to adapt to the multichain nature of the space. The CEO of Phantom identified that there are some technical hurdles to cross as wallets that have originally been native to one chain move to support other networks. He highlighted two issues: The method for deriving keys on various chains differs, and there is a need to build a system that manages multiple nodes on the back end.

Another issue that has come up recently concerning wallets is the speculation about possible airdrops to decentralize their operations. Speculation recently got so wild that MetaMask warned the general public against a rumor that suggested the app was taking a snapshot for an airdrop on March 31.

Millman said Phantom has no short- to medium-term plans to do a token. According to him, the cost associated with using airdrops to attract users is not worth it and does not lead to the desired impact. He added that Uniswap’s airdrop did not make a meaningful difference in the long term.

The Phantom CEO also highlighted how the regulatory concerns in crypto are an issue that self-custody wallets are not absorbed from, and there is always a need for projects to look over their shoulder.

The county of Santa Cruz in Northern California is one of the latest to adopt and implement blockchain-based solutions on a governmental level. 

In a meeting of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors held on April 25, the members unanimously decided to go forward with implementing the use of digital wallets for government services and official documentation purposes.

According to the final consensus of the meeting, the white-label digital wallet powered by Humbl will launch a three-stage pilot program starting in July 2023. Beta testers during the pilot period will be mobile users seeking to access government services such as bicycle registration and RV parking registration.

Other potential pilots would be for registration of park facilities, tracking volunteer hours, over-the-counter building permit distribution and pet licensing.

Zach Friend, a supervisor for Santa Cruz County involved with the situation, said:

“We believe the value of digitizing paper documents, records, and services is an important step forward for the convenience of Santa Cruz County residents and improving equity and access for our community.”

Following a successful pilot, the county plans to provide a formal report and a rollout plan for no later than September 2023.

The digital wallet project began to take shape in April 2022 after the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors collaborated with Humbl on the digital wallet technology infrastructure needed to begin a pilot program. 

While local officials are pushing forward with the plans for a digital wallet, an open discussion forum on the county’s website revealed concern from local residents.

One such commenter by the name of Becky Seinbruner asked to “suspend further action and progress” on the digital wallet developments. Seinbruner raised concerns over “inappropriate use and sales of personal data” on the part of the infrastructure provider Humbl.

According to the official documents, during the pilot period, local officials will be assessing if users trust the underlying technology and understand what is happening “under the hood.”

The team behind Lens, a Web3 social media protocol, has announced the launch of a new solution to scale blockchain social media apps. Called “Momoka,” the new network processes and stores posts, comments and shares, taking this data off the Polygon network and thereby increasing scalability for Lens, according to an April 26 announcement viewed by Cointelegraph.

Lens is a blockchain protocol that allows users to form a portable “social graph,” or digital set of connections, between themselves and others. When users form a connection with another person on one Lens app, they can transfer those connections to any other app built on the protocol. There are 17 different Lens-based social media apps listed on the protocol’s official website, including Buttrfly, DumplingTV, Lenster, Lenstube and others.

Lens runs on the Polygon network, a layer 2 of Ethereum.

In a technical document linked to in the announcement, the Lens team stated that the Polygon network cannot handle the transaction volume or data-storage needs of large-scale social media apps, making it necessary for a new “optimistic L3 hyperscaling data solution” to be launched. According to the document, shared blockchain networks can only handle up to 200 transactions per second (TPS), while the previous incarnation of Lens could only handle 40 to 50 TPS. By contrast, it stated that Twitter often does 25,000 TPS during peak periods.

The team anticipated this limitation could prevent the protocol from scaling as its user base grew. To solve this problem, Momoka launched as a layer 2 of Polygon itself, or an “L3” of the Ethereum network. Momoka uses Bundlr, a decentralized storage platform built on Arweave, to store large files while storing verification data about them.

According to the technical paper, the network consists of three types of nodes: submitters, verifiers and timestamps. Submitters validate transactions, build metadata and submit them to Bundlr. Verifiers monitor the data submitted by submitters and confirm that it is valid. And timestamps determine the proper block number and timestamp for a particular piece of data.

The paper states that this system should “[provide] consumers the experience (instant posts, etc.) they have come to expect from social networks.”

Stani Kulechov, the founder of Lens Protocol, believes Momoka will be an important step toward spurring mass adoption of Web3 social apps:

“To be competitive with web2, decentralized social must scale. With the ability to support mass consumer adoption, we’ll see continued web3 innovation – new, exciting and compelling features and business models that will spur web3 adoption.”

Several companies in recent years have created decentralized social media protocols, including Lens, Subsocial, DeSo and others. Developers hope these apps will help broaden the appeal of blockchain networks beyond the financial world. While none of them have attained the success of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other Web2 social apps, some blockchain experts believe decentralized social media will be the next big thing in crypto.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has been at the forefront of the United States' cryptocurrency crackdown. In the last few months, the agency has filed several enforcement actions against major crypto companies that allegedly violated security laws.

Critics say the agency has adopted a regulation-by-enforcement approach without providing a proper set of rules that fit the unique features of crypto assets. A major source of confusion is the definition of a security and whether it can apply to a highly diverse set of assets such as cryptocurrencies. 

Despite being pressured in a congressional hearing last week, Gensler seems unwilling to take on the political responsibility of entering a constructive dialogue with the industry. 

For many crypto companies targeted by the SEC, the choice is between entering an expensive legal battle with the regulator or shutting down operations in the US and moving overseas. Most crypto companies will likely prefer saving millions of dollars in legal expenses and opt for the latter option.

The new offering will allow users to mint “.BinanceUS” domains, providing users with easily understandable names for cryptocurrency wallets to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrency in the Binance.US app. These unique domains also serve as a digital identity across compatible Web3 services, applications and platforms.

Binance.US and Unstoppable Domains announced the launch of the service on April 26 and it will go live in May. Binance.​US domains are minted on the Polygon blockchain, which allows the generation of decentralized domains without gas fees or renewal costs.

The partnership will also allow Unstoppable Domains users to use Binance.​US to withdraw cryptocurrencies to various Unstoppable Domains addresses, which include .crypto, .nft and .x domains.

A statement from Binance.US Business Development Vice President Nandini Maheshwari, shared with Cointelegraph, highlighted the provision of digital identity ownership as a key factor in the partnership with Unstoppable and Polygon:

“Increasing accessibility to Web3 while maintaining a safe and secure ecosystem for customers is at the core of Binance.US’s mission.”

Unstoppable Domains will be responsible for custodying all .BinanceUS domains, which can only be created through the Binance.US app.

The decentralized domain service provider has partnered with a number of Web3, blockchain and cryptocurrency companies over the past year. This includes a partnership with Polygon to provide the ability to mint “.polygon” Web3 domains. Unstoppable also provided an avenue for 1inch Network decentralized finance (DeFi) users to send cryptocurrencies to Web3 domain addresses in November.

Unstoppable Domains and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) have seen burgeoning user numbers through 2022 and 2023 as demand for Web3 services continues to grow. American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase tapped as its decentralized domain name partner in September 2022, providing users with free.cb.id usernames like ‘cointelegraph.cb.id’ to replace alpha-numeric cryptocurrency wallet addresses.

Circle, the creator of US Dollar Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, has launched a mainnet protocol that lets users transfer USDC between Ethereum and Avalanche, according to an April 26 announcement. Previously, Avalanche users who held USDC on Ethereum had to deposit their coins with a Circle partner or use a third-party bridge to transfer their USDC from one network to the other. The new Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) protocol appears to do away with this need for USDC bridges.

The team released a video on April 13 showing how the new protocol works. Unlike a traditional bridge, it doesn’t lock tokens sent to its contract. Instead, it completely destroys them and issues new tokens on the receiving network. Users can redeem these new tokens for bank deposits directly, by depositing the tokens with Circle or its partners.

In the announcement, the team said that it expects CCTP to solve the problem of “fragmentation” in the Web3 ecosystem. Currently, there are multiple unofficial versions of USDC floating around on various networks, most of which are the result of tokens on one network being bridged to another. Now that there is an official way to transfer coins from one network to another, the team expects these unofficial copies to slowly decline in use, making the token less confusing to use.

The team said that many of the largest cross-chain protocols have already pledged to use CCTP going forward, including Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero, LI.FI, MetaMask, Wormhole and others.

Joao Reginatto, Circle’s vice president of product, said he believes the new protocol will help improve liquidity and capital efficiency in decentralized finance:

“With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe and fungible asset in native USDC.""

USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. The company claims that each USDC token is backed dollar-for-dollar in its reserves. Users can mint USDC by opening an account and depositing cash with either Circle itself or one of its partners, such as Coinbase. Once they’ve done this, they can receive the coin on several networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Stellar and Polkadot.

Users have lost billions of dollars worth of USDC and other cryptocurrencies due to bridge hacks over the past few years, as attackers have repeatedly figured out how to remove locked coins from bridge contracts and leave their copies on the receiving network with no backing. This has left developers wondering how to secure bridges for future use as digital assets become more mainstream.

Bitcoin’s price is down 10% — New bear market or correction?

On this week’s episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph’s resident expert discusses if the latest price of Bitcoin is a sign of a new bear market starting or just a healthy correction.

In today’s Market Report episode, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman covers the potential triggers to move Bitcoin’s price away from $27,000, including the United State Federal Reserve meeting on May 3. The show airs every Tuesday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

The first news article discussed the catalysts for Bitcoin’s next move, including whether the Fed will follow the markets’ consensus of a 25-basis-point interest rate increase on May 3. The video analyzes how Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,793

 should react to the central bank’s decision and explains how interest rates affect families and businesses.

In Pechman’s opinion, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market should decline considering the U.S. is nearing its debt limit and the economy is displaying signs of weakness and recession. Pechman does not believe there’s a rationale for Bitcoin trading at $25,000, as some analysts have suggested.

On to the show’s next topic, Pechman discusses Coinbase’s court action against the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Coinbase is looking to force the SEC to respond to its petition seeking rules for the crypto industry… asking the SEC to provide clarification about how it goes about classifying tokens as securities.”

According to Pechman, it seems like the tables have turned, as the regulator has been postponing its ruling and harassing exchanges without ever giving some direction on what sets the bar for tokens to become securities. The conclusion? This case can have a bigger impact than previously imagined because judges will take note of the SEC’s arguments.

In the last part of The Market Report, Pechman argues that Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 is in a bad place due to average transaction fees above $4. Consequently, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s smart contracts in Ether terms plunged to their lowest levels since August 2020.

At the end of the show, Pechman focuses on Ether’s derivatives markets, more specifically the put-to-call options volume. Currently, the protective put options outnumber the neutral-to-bullish call options by more than four times. Judging by pro traders’ bearish view, Ether’s price will unlikely be able to sustain the $1,850 support.

Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, took to Twitter on April 24 to announce a new cryptocurrency-related project developed by the firm.

Visa’s upcoming crypto product is designed to drive mainstream adoption of public blockchain networks and stablecoin payments, Sheffield noted.

According to a Visa job posting published on April 20, the company’s crypto division is building the “next generation of products” to facilitate the digital commerce of everyday life.

In order to develop the product, Visa is seeking to hire software engineers focused on programming, backend systems Web3 technologies.

“Particularly interested in experience using Github Copilot and other AI assisted engineering tools to write and debug smart contracts,” Sheffield wrote on Twitter.

Among preferred applicant qualifications, Visa listed a good understanding of layer 1 and layer 2 solutions alongside experience with writing smart contracts using the programming language Solidity. Introduced specifically for the Ethereum Network, Solidity is used to create smart contracts on blockchain platforms and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.

The position also requires good understanding of public and permissioned distributed ledger networks, security protocols, private key custody as well as new Ethereum enhancements such as ERC-4337.

One of the world’s largest payments companies, Visa made a major move into the crypto industry in 2020, partnering with the blockchain firm Circle to support the USD Coin

Ethereum staking withdrawals have entered their third “round,” but Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 staking deposits have almost equaled them, according to the data from the analytics platform Nansen.

Ethereum staking withdrawals started ramping up for the third time on April 24 and into April 25. According to Nansen, the crypto exchange Kraken was responsible for a large portion of these withdrawals.

A “round” refers to the number of days taken to process partial withdrawals and rewards. Nansen says it currently takes just under four and a half days.

The last large batch of withdrawals on April 24 was a total of 61,608 ETH in principal and reward withdrawals. However, at the same time, there were 63,009 ETH deposits, reported Nansen.

This has resulted in zero change in the balance of staked ETH over the past 24 hours.

In February, Kraken was forced to halt its Ethereum staking services following enforcement action and a fine by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused it of selling unregistered securities.

As a result, much of the ETH withdrawn early on has been from Kraken wallets as assets get returned to stakers. According to Nansen, 2.3% of the total withdrawable ETH remains from Kraken.

Nansen currently reports there is a total of 632,651 ETH waiting in the pending withdrawal queue. At current prices, this is valued at around $1.16 billion.

Before the last wave of withdrawals commenced, Nansen reported an all-time high in the total amount of staked ETH. The figure hit 18,796,663 ETH valued at around $34.5 billion on April 24.

The current figure, which is slightly lower than this peak, represents 14.5% of the total Ether supply. Due to the EIP-1559 burning mechanism, the total supply has declined by 114,077 ETH (around $209 million) since the Merge in September.

Concerns over a massive exodus of staked Ethereum following the Shapella upgrade have been quashed. Token Unlocks is reporting that a total of 1.66 million ETH has been withdrawn since April 12, but 1.07 million ETH has been deposited, signaling there is still quite an appetite for staking Ether.

Regulators in the United States have choked out the cryptocurrency sector to the point of death, according to Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,793

 bull and billionaire tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya.

“Crypto is dead in America,” he boldly claimed in an April 22 episode of the All-In podcast.

Palihapitiya’s comment came in response to the news that cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is now considering a move offshore. He pointed the finger at Gary Gensler, the chair of the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission:

“Crypto is dead in America. I mean now you have Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto — so the United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto.”

While Palihapitiya said that the U.S. likely views crypto as a threat to its “establishment,” the tech investor did however attribute some fault to the sector:

“In fairness to the regulators, [the crypto sector] did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.”

He rounded out his analysis by concluding that the good actors are now “paying the price” for the bad work done by FTX and other firms that have impacted the reputation of the industry.

“The bill has come due for them,” he added.

David Sacks, one of the show’s co-hosts, said the U.S. may be trying to choke out crypto because it may eat into the dominance of the U.S. dollar:

“I think it’s probably not a coincidence that you’re seeing all these concerns about de-dollarization at the same time they're cracking down on crypto.”

But the overall impact will be a net negative one, implied Sacks, who is of the view that pushing crypto companies offshore will be “terrible for American innovation.”

Other commentators have described the issue at hand as “Operation Choke Point 2.0” — an alleged orchestrated effort by regulators to discourage banks from holding crypto or providing services to crypto companies.

Palihapitiya was baffled by the notion that Coinbase  — a digital asset trading platform that he says had “played by the rules, stood in line” and “tried to do the right things” — was no closer to receiving regulatory clarity than the now-bankrupt FTX.

“How is that even possible,” Palihapitiya asked. Sacks answered that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried “had skills in gaming the system.”

In March, the SEC issued Coinbase a Wells notice — which typically implies the regulator plans on pursuing legal action against the firm for potential violations of U.S. securities laws.

If a lawsuit is filed, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says that the exchange will be ready to litigate.

Ordinals Finance, an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow inscriptions, has been accused of performing an exit scam, also known as a “rug pull.”

Advertisement
Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

In an April 24 press release seen by Cointelegraph, blockchain security firm CertiK reported that the protocol’s developer pulled 256 million OFI tokens out of its smart contracts using a “safuToken” function. Another 13 million OFI was removed through an “ownerRewithdraw” function, bringing the total number of tokens withdrawn to 269 million, CertiK stated.

According to the blockchain security firm, the total loss to investors is $1 million. CoinGecko data shows that the market capitalization for OFI was $2.3 million before the alleged exit, but it fell to slightly over $143,000 afterward. This implies that losses were more than $2 million. However, some OFI token owners may have sold as the news broke, which may account for the lower amount being reported by CertiK. 

Blockchain data shows that the Ordinals deployer account withdrew over 256 million OFI tokens using the safuToken function. These funds were allegedly sent to a separate Ethereum account through multiple transactions. Blockchain data shows that this address received OFI from multiple addresses before depositing the tokens into Tornado Cash.

The project's Twitter account appears to have been deleted.

Further investigation reveals that after receiving the 256 million OFI, the deployer account made 12 separate transactions swapping OFI for Ether

.

The deployer then transferred over 85.5 ETH to the account ending in “cCF,” at which point it was deposited into Tornado Cash.

The safuToken transfer was executed on a contract labeled “OEB Staking.” This function is listed at the bottom of the file, on lines 1445-1450, and appears to allow the “owner” of the contract to transfer all staked tokens to itself.

The deployer account also made multiple calls to the OFI Staking contract to transfer tokens to itself, each time using a function on lines 305–308 called “ownerRewithdraw.” It appears to allow the owner to withdraw any amount of tokens from the staking contract, as long as the balance in the contract is greater than a variable called “totalOwedValue.”

Despite their large numbers of followers — and being potential targets for scammers impersonating them — not every major Crypto Twitter personality has signed up or been given a blue checkmark since the platform removed legacy verification on April 20.

In a debate that’s almost exclusively limited to die-hard enthusiasts of the social media platform, many individuals have opted not to pay Twitter $8 each month to retain a blue checkmark formerly given as a symbol of verification. Though it’s unclear whether certain high-profile figures in the crypto space have chosen to pay for the “Twitter Blue” subscription to retain their verification status, some of their profiles still show the checkmark.

Elon Musk seemingly wants members of the platform to compete for the status symbol in order to drive additional revenue to Twitter. Among those staying in the game include the CEO himself; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin; Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao; Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Litecoin 

LTC

$80.31

The change in Twitter’s blue checkmark system led to many users unaware of the paid option to mistake fake accounts for real ones, with one even impersonating pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. A user set up an account with a similar name to the firm, paid for the blue checkmark and claimed that the company would offer free insulin, resulting in Eli Lilly stock dropping roughly 5%.

Musk’s decision to sunset legacy blue checkmarks effectively removed the verification status for which Twitter had become known, though there are additional labels and other types of checkmarks for organizations, businesses and governmental leaders. For example, gold checkmarks reportedly costing $1,000 per month are intended for verified business accounts, but the platform has reportedly been giving some away for free — as well as taking them back. Accounts held by Binance, Binance.US, Gemini, Kraken, KuCoin, OKX, Floki Inu and others currently show the gold mark.

The Ether price has struggled to sustain $1,850 support since April 21, the same level it held before the rally toward $2,100 initiated on April 13. Investors have reason to question whether there are buyers, considering the 13.5% price correction in six days and the $548 million in leveraged futures longs liquidated between April 19 and April 21.

The basic building blocks of DeFi and NFTs in one place - the ABCs of Crypto Report by Cointelegraph Research

First, the regulatory environment seems to have gotten stricter for centralized exchanges. Dubai-based Bybit, for instance, announced that all users must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification by May 8 for order execution and withdrawals. Until May 8, non-KYC users have a monthly withdrawal limit of 100,000 Tether 

USDT

$1.00

.

United States-based crypto exchange Gemini announced on April 21 the upcoming launch of a derivatives platform outside the country. The uncertain regulatory environment forced the company to seek alternative locales, though only clients from selected regions can access the new service. The list excludes the U.S., Canada and most European countries, except Switzerland.

Ethereum network is navigating in troubled waters

Given its lower use in decentralized applications (DApps), the Ethereum network is probably experiencing its own problems. For starters, total deposits on Ethereum’s smart contracts in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 terms plunged to their lowest levels since August 2020. Such an analysis already excludes the effects of native Ethereum staking, which recently started to allow withdrawals.

According to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps reached 15.3 million ETH in total value locked (TVL) on April 24. That compares with 22.0 million ETH six months prior, a 30% decline. As a comparison, TVL on BNB Smart Chain in BNB 

BNB

$314

 terms declined by 20%, and the Polygon network’s MATIC 

MATIC

$0.8784

 deposits decreased by 11%.

Furthermore, Ethereum network dominance on stablecoin deposits reached its lowest level in more than 12 months at 54%, down from 64% in December 2022. On the other hand, the Tron network was the biggest winner in stablecoins due to its low transaction fees. As a comparison, the Ethereum network’s average transaction fee has been above $4 since February 2023.

Ethereum’s market share by volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) peaked at 75% in the week ending March 5 but steadily declined to 44% in the week ending April 16.

Gainers on DEX trading volumes were Arbitrum, increasing to 22.2% from 7%, and BNB Smart Chain, growing to 16.6% from 5.1% since March 5. One might argue that the success of the Ethereum network’s scaling solution necessarily reflects bullishness for Ether’s price, but that relationship is not so direct.

Pro traders are leaning bearish

To understand whether professional traders are pricing higher odds of an ETH price decline, one should analyze the options market. Traders can gauge the market’s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are used for bearish ones.

A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.

Related: Ethereum price lower highs vs. Bitcoin hint at more downside in April

The put-to-call ratio for Ether options volume reached its lowest level in over three months, indicating excess demand for neutral-to-bearish puts. Currently, the protective put options outnumber the neutral-to-bullish call options by more than four times.

Judging by the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. and the impacts of competing networks, whether using second-layer technologies or not, odds are the Ether price will unlikely be able to sustain the $1,850 support. Derivatives traders clearly reflect the higher probability of negative price movements.

Despite their large numbers of followers — and being potential targets for scammers impersonating them — not every major Crypto Twitter personality has signed up or been given a blue checkmark since the platform removed legacy verification on April 20.

In a debate that’s almost exclusively limited to die-hard enthusiasts of the social media platform, many individuals have opted not to pay Twitter $8 each month to retain a blue checkmark formerly given as a symbol of verification. Though it’s unclear whether certain high-profile figures in the crypto space have chosen to pay for the “Twitter Blue” subscription to retain their verification status, some of their profiles still show the checkmark.

Elon Musk seemingly wants members of the platform to compete for the status symbol in order to drive additional revenue to Twitter. Among those staying in the game include the CEO himself; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin; Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao; Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; Litecoin

 creator Charlie Lee; Pixelmatic CEO Samson Mow; podcaster Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano; Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz and MicroStrategy Executive Chair Michael Saylor. Musk said he was personally footing the bill in order for certain users to keep their blue checkmarks, including Star Trek actor William Shatner, who has 2.5 million followers.

ETH price risks more losses vs. Bitcoin

As of April 24, the ETH/BTC pair was down about 5.5% from its local high of 0.0709 BTC six days ago. The same period witnessed Ether declining nearly 15% and Bitcoin dropping 11.25% in United States dollar terms.

For now, ETH holds above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near 0.0672 BTC. But if the March 2023 fractal is any indication, Ethereum's price could drop sharply below the support wave.

The ETH/BTC pair saw a pullback trend in March after testing the 200-day EMA (the blue wave), breaking below its 50-day EMA in the process.

If the fractal plays out similarly in April, the downside target is 0.0627 BTC by the month’s end, about 7% lower than the current levels, a level that served as a major support in March and April.

This target also coincides with Ether’s long-term ascending trendline support — the “buy zone” in the chart below — that has been capping its bearish attempts since June 2022.

Weekly Ethereum institutional flows beat BTC

Interestingly, Ethereum’s underperformance versus Bitcoin was counter to institutional flows for the past week. 

Ethereum funds attracted $17 million to their coffers in the week ending April 21 versus Bitcoin's $53.1 million outflow, according to CoinShares’ latest report.

“These inflows suggest there is increasing confidence amongst investors following the successful implementation of the Shapella upgrade,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted, adding that they “were solely from Europe.”

As for Bitcoin, the outflow began around April 14 when the coin reached $30,000, a psychological resistance level. Butterfill said the BTC's drop to below $27,500 resulted from profit-taking in the absence of macroeconomic triggers.

Join us on social networks

Reminiscent of Tamagotchi and Pokémon, the wildly popular digital pets and creatures of the 1990s, CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based game where players can collect, trade and breed digital virtual cats. CryptoKitties was the first Ethereum-based game, and its popularity underscored many of the network’s scaling issues.

This digital cat-breeding blockchain game caused quite a bit of congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, peaking in 2020. However, the game’s creators were able to address these issues.

What is CryptoKitties?

Launched in 2017, CryptoKitties was built by Dapper Labs, the company that uses blockchain technology to bring nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and new forms of digital engagement to fans around the world. CryptoKitties is also considered one of the world’s first-ever blockchain games.

In the game, each one of the digital collectible cats possesses a unique genome that determines its physical traits. Cats can be bred to create new virtual kittens and unlock rare “cattributes” or in-game cat features.

Is CryptoKitties an NFT game? Yes, CryptoKitties are unique, one-of-a-kind assets backed by NFTs, making them rare and valuable. They were built on Ethereum using the ERC-721 token standard, which allowed for the creation of unique NFTs.

CryptoKitties can be sold and traded, and cats with rare traits can fetch high prices. The rarest CryptoKitty of all time is the genesis cat, aptly named “Genesis” because it was the very first CryptoKitty hatched by the game’s creators. Genesis was sold in 2017 for 246.926 Ether 

ETH

$1,853

, or around $119,328 at the time of selling. Ether has since appreciated, and so has the genesis cat.

How does CryptoKitties work?

Blockchain technology remains at the core of this game, but the unique CryptoKitties gameplay can be credited to its Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA aims to mimic real genetic principles by structuring the smart contract code of each kitten like the DNA of actual living creatures.

Each kitty possesses its own digital genetic pattern, which in turn determines what type of offspring it will produce, in addition to its unique physical traits. This genome is stored in a smart contract, which is self-executing lines of code dependent on predetermined conditions.

Any two CryptoKitties can be bred together and produce offspring with their own distinctive cattributes. The immutable genotype stored in the smart contract likewise determines this new kitty’s phenotype. The GA mixes the code from both CryptoKitties to create new kittens, with the split between the parents varying every time they mate. This allows for unique kittens to be produced each time.

The game’s main premise is that players have to breed and sell their cats, which will allow them to earn ETH, especially for rarer cats. Generation and Cooldown are two crucial features of the game — both are necessary to understand which cats to purchase and breed during the selection process.

First, Generation determines how many generations a kitty is from its original parent. New Generation 0 kitties were released every 15 minutes during the first year of CryptoKitties. These kitties have no offspring yet, so if two Generation 0 kitties breed, they will produce Generation 1 offspring.

The Generation of each offspring is always one number higher than that of its parent from a higher generation. For instance, if a Generation 3 and a Generation 9 breed, their offspring will be Generation 10. This information can be found below each kitty’s photo, abbreviated as “Gen.”

Cooldown refers to a kitty’s breeding pace, such that a kitty with a lower cooldown will have a shorter breeding time. Kitties from higher generations will also have high cooldown rates. Both Generation and Cooldown affect the price of CryptoKitties, as these will determine how desirable they are on the market.

Can you play CryptoKitties on mobile?

Those looking to explore CryptoKitties gameplay on mobile can do so through an HTC mobile phone, which exclusively carries the United States mobile app of CryptoKitties.

Technically, however, players looking for information on how to play CryptoKitties on Android or iOS devices can simply access the mobile version of the website through a mobile browser. However, serious players looking for a dedicated app can currently only do so via an HTC phone.

How to get started with CryptoKitties

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up a CryptoKitties account to get started:

1. Create a MetaMask wallet

Players must first have an existing MetaMask wallet or create one. MetaMask will allow users to buy, sell and breed CryptoKitties. Once a wallet has been created, new users can proceed to the CyrptoKitties homepage, where they will be asked to link their MetaMask wallet upon clicking “Start” on the upper right-hand side of the screen.

2. Purchase Ether (ETH)

CryptoKitties can be purchased using Ether, which can, in turn, be bought from cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase. Ether can then be transferred to MetaMask to ensure that players have enough funds to purchase their CryptoKitties.

3. Create a CryptoKitties account

After connecting a user’s MetaMask wallet with CryptoKitties, they will be asked to provide their email address for important updates and key in a nickname they wish to use in-game. Players have the option to go through a basic “Kitten Class” tutorial where they will learn how to breed CryptoKitties.

How to play and earn in CryptoKitties

Once a player has successfully set up their CryptoKitties account, they can start playing the game. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to earn money playing CryptoKitties:

1. Buy CryptoKitties

Players can now view CryptoKitties for sale through the website or secondary NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Offers can also be made to other players, allowing others to bid on cats even if they aren’t for sale. The owner can choose to decline or accept the offer. Each offer expires after three days.

New players have the option to purchase just one kitty to get started or buy a pair right away. If a player decides to purchase just one CryptoKitty, they can begin breeding it with a Sire from another player. If they purchase two CryptoKitties immediately, they can breed their cats for a much lower fee.

How much are CryptoKitties? Prices vary, but kitties may sell for as low as 0.001 ETH or as high as 600 ETH, maybe even more. Factors such as how rare a particular kitty is and how sought-after its cattributes are can affect the price it will fetch in the market.

2. Breed CryptoKitties

As mentioned, players can breed two of their own kitties together or breed them with a public Sire. It is best to breed kitties coming from the same generation to produce a kitty with a relatively low Generation as well.

To breed one’s own Kitties together, a player simply has to click on a kitty they want to assign as the “Sire” or the father. Then, click the “Breed” button and select “Sire with my Kitties.” Next, the “Dame” or mother cat can be selected to complete the breeding pair. To proceed, click “OK, give them some privacy” to allow the kitties to breed in peace.

To breed one’s Kitty with a public Sire, a player has to select a Sire from the marketplace and select the “Breed Now” option. They can then select a Dame from their own litter to form a breeding pair and then proceed with the option to give the Kitties privacy to breed. As previously mentioned, both options cost minimal fees in ETH, which goes to community-run bots and smart contracts.

3. Sell or Sire CryptoKitties

Once a player has produced new breeds of CryptoKitties, they can be put up for sale or Sired to the public. Each kitty in a litter will have “Sell” and “Breed” options, which will lead to auction pages.

Players can create a Siring auction by clicking “Breed,” which will put their Kitty up for Siring via the Siring market. “Sell” likewise creates an auction, setting the kitty up for sale on the marketplace. The player can select the starting price, ending price and auction duration.

This week in DeFi saw the hacker behind the $8.9 million SafeMoon exploit agree to return the majority of the stolen funds. According to the project’s developers, the hacker will return 80% while keeping the remaining 20%.

The heavy traffic on the network allowed a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot to make millions in sandwich exploits.

Ethereum is often depicted as traditional finance’s adversary in a Manichean struggle for decentralization. In reality, there isn’t any conflict at all. Rather than subverting the traditional financial sector, Ethereum is improving it. Soon, the two systems will be inextricably entwined. 

Ethereum’s core value propositions — self-custody, transparency and disintermediation — are enormously relevant to financial institutions, and they can be realized within existing regulatory frameworks. Ethereum has already taken the first steps toward institutional adoption, and with its unmatched network decentralization, it is all but destined to become the primary settlement layer for the world’s financial transactions.

Neutrality in a multipolar world

Ethereum isn’t here to deliver a stateless alternative currency or an anonymized shadow economy. What it offers is simple: neutrality.

Ethereum is the global financial system’s first truly unbiased referee, and its arrival couldn’t be more timely. The geopolitical stability afforded by the United States’ preeminence is eroding, and domestic politics in major economies have become increasingly volatile. In a multipolar world, the financial system urgently needs to maintain reliable rules of the road.

Related: Thanks to Ethereum, ‘altcoin’ is no longer a slur

Ethereum’s system for settling transactions and storing data is practically incorruptible. That is largely because of the unrivaled decentralization of its consensus layer, which spans more than 500,000 validators distributed among more than 10,000 physical nodes in dozens of countries. Despite concerns to the contrary, Ethereum is trending toward greater decentralization over time, not less.

To be sure, Ethereum will never replace traditional contracts or legal authorities for mediating disputes. What it promises, with its inviolable and unbiased code, is to prevent countless disputes from arising in the first place.

Solving the principal-agent problem

From Celsius to FTX and Silvergate, the events that led up to “crypto winter” speak more to the shortcomings of traditional finance than to the failings of crypto. In each instance, the classic principal-agent problem was worsened by lax oversight and overcentralization.

Historically, the default approach to this problem has been regulation. Greater oversight is certainly needed, but Ethereum offers more foundational solutions. Trustless smart contracts and distributed ledgers can remove certain dimensions of the principal-agent problem entirely.

Soon, Ethereum and its scaling chains will permeate traditional banking and asset management. From savings accounts to retirement portfolios, virtually every investor will self-custody their assets in trustless smart contracts, and carefully regulated on-ramps will render the tokenization of fiat currencies virtually frictionless.

Ethereum's market capitalization, 2016-23. Source: CoinGecko

Meanwhile, investors and, eventually, regulators will insist that asset managers report fund performance using trustless on-chain oracles. In these areas, Ethereum won’t run afoul of regulations, it will reinforce them. Eventually, authorities will become as attentive to the technical specifications of smart contracts as they are to required liquidity reserves.

The future of Ethereum is not permissionless. Identity-based permissioning will be standard fare, but so seamless as to be practically unnoticeable. With the proliferation of central bank digital currencies, state censorship will be a serious concern. Laws restraining governments from arbitrarily freezing digital assets will gather significant political momentum.

In short, Ethereum has the potential to dramatically reduce private financial malfeasance, but its impact on state censorship will be more limited.

Nascent institutional adoption

Ethereum’s future may still be far off, but its building blocks are already here. Decentralized finance (DeFi) overheated into a speculative conflagration in 2021, but that frenzy of activity spurred considerable innovation. The technology now exists to create a wide array of disintermediated markets and tokenized financial instruments.

What is missing is connectivity with the broader financial system. That is the focus of an emerging class of regulated fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and custodians, such as Circle. The U.S.-based company had laid the foundation for the digital economy with USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, its tokenized dollar. Circle is now building out additional critical infrastructure, such as hybrid fiat-and-crypto accounts that on-ramp directly to Ethereum and its scaling chains.

Related: Federal regulators are preparing to pass judgment on Ethereum

In the coming years, expect to see a proliferation of tokenized securities, starting with risk-off fixed-income assets. There will also be heavy investment in Ethereum staking pools, which will emerge as a critical strategic asset in the institutional crypto market. Other areas of focus will include on-chain financial reporting, streamlined user flows for regulatory compliance and institutional-grade tokenized derivatives.

To be sure, a recent spate of enforcement actions has cooled development activity in the U.S., but it will remain a major market for the coming wave of regulated protocols.

Tending the infinite garden

The surge in regulatory pressure on crypto, particularly DeFi, marks the end of an era. Large swaths of Ethereum’s ecosystem, especially protocols that can’t or won’t adapt to the changing landscape, will effectively be weeded out. Those that remain, however, will be well adapted to integration with the existing financial system. Ethereum’s transformative impact on traditional finance has only just begun.

Criticism has been leveled at a new euro-pegged stablecoin released in France due to a decision to restrict peer-to-peer transactions.

French bank Societe Generale-Forge (SGF) released the Ethereum-based stablecoin called EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on April 20, which is available to only qualified institutional clients.

According to observers who reviewed its smart contract code, itsERC-20 transfers need to first be approved by a centralized registrar — presumably one controlled by the bank — before the transaction is processed.

In an April 20 tweet, pseudonymous smart contract engineer “alephv.eth” explained:

“They coded it so they have to whitelist all users, process all user transfers, and even process your ERC20 approvals before they process your 'transferFrom' lmao.”

She further mocked the code in a separate post, stating it was a ""radical commitment to inefficiency in the name of regulation.""

Nonfungible token project founder “foobar” tweeted to his over 127,000 followers on April 20 that it’s “the worst code I’ve ever seen” and described the stablecoin as a “laughing stock.”

Crypto researcher Mason Versluis tweeted that the code was “absolutely horrible” and suggested the French bank “stop trying to weasel” into crypto.

Plenty of others chipped in on the criticism, but Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 investor Ryan Berckman provided a more neutral analysis.

He explained that many traditional financial firms like SGF will take “baby steps” as they move into blockchain and digital assets:

“Obviously, non-compliant, non-composable, allowlist-style stables are going to be uncompetitive in the market. Baby steps, they are coming from tradfi, they’ll see it soon enough and switch to a USDC-style denylist.”

Berckman explained SGF may also be incorrect in its claim to be the first bank to launch an institutional stablecoin on a public blockchain. He pointed to the AUDN stablecoin minted on Ethereum in March by National Australia Bank (NAB), which claimed to be the second bank to launch a stablecoin.

Regardless, Berckman expects more banks to follow suit in the months to come, stating that he is “certain” SGF won’t be the last bank to launch a stablecoin on a public network.

SGF’s stablecoin isn’t intended for public use — at least to begin with.

EURCV is only strictly available to institutional clients onboarded by the bank through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, according to the bank’s April 20 announcement.

The stablecoin is designed to bridge the gap between assets in traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem.

A total of 10 million EURCV tokens were minted on Ethereum on April , according to Ethereum explorer Etherscan. All 10 million tokens are held by one wallet address.

The stablecoin was launched on the back of growing demand for a new settlement asset to process on-chain transactions.

A pair of computer science researchers recently published pre-print research indicating that the nascent cryptocurrency market is beginning to show a level of maturity similar to the traditional equities market.

Dubbed “Collective dynamics, diversification and optimal portfolio construction for cryptocurrencies,” the paper was written by Nick James, a fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Data Science, and Max Menzies, an assistant professor at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications, affiliated with Tsinghua University.

Related: What’s next for EU’s crypto industry as European Parliament passes MiCA?

The pair set out to determine what role cryptocurrency plays in portfolio diveristy and how the cryptocurrency market compares to the traditional equities market.

Their findings indicate that, while there remains some key differences between the two markets, cryptocurrency is beginning to show palpable and demonstrable signs of maturity:

“Overall, we have uncovered nuanced similarities and differences between the cryptocurrency and equity markets. These mathematical properties signal increased signatures of maturity in the collective dynamics and diversification benefit of different portfolio spreads.”

The team used a study approach called collective dynamics to discern the mathematical properties — with particular focus on measuring interactions between groups of data called “hierarchical clustering” — underlying both the cryptocurrency and equities markets. In order to compare the two, they measured diversification spreads across respective portfolios.

Both markets showed similar hierarchical clustering. The study authors also state that there's evidence for “the existence of a ‘best value’ cryptocurrency portfolio.”

According to the researchers, by comparison, cryptocurrency may even offer a lower complexity threshold for diversification:

“Retail investors with limited ability to hold complex portfolios of many cryptocurrencies may be sufficiently diversified with a relatively small portfolio across just 16 cryptocurrencies.”

The study authors note that cryptocurrency has been called “an immature market, characterized by significant swings in volatility and occasionally described as lacking rhyme or reason,” but the research appears to indicate otherwise.

Ultimately, the study concludes that the cryptocurrency market is showing signs of maturity, but it's not quite on par with the equities market just yet.

The researchers raise the issue of opaque underlying business functions related to cryptocurrencies, stating that related business cycles are “far less clear” than in the equities market. They also note a need for “the development of better understood and widely disseminated cryptocurrency investment principles.”

1inch Network is the latest of a host of Ethereum-based platforms and services deploying on the zero-knowledge proof (zk-proof) based scaling platform. Uniswap, SushiSwap, Maker and Curve Finance are also preparing to launch on the zk-proof roll-up zkSync Era.

1inch Network co-founder Sergej Kunz highlighted the promise of the layer-2 solution as his platform joins a handful of first-movers to integrate with the zk-proof powered protocol:

“As zkSync Era gains steam, 1inch users will benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.”

A statement from Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski, who heads up the zkSync development firm, notes that DeFi protocols have been a major factor in the uptake of zkSync era:

“DeFi has been a driving force behind zkSync Era’s explosive growth that has seen over $200 million in TVL driven to the protocol in just three short weeks, and we expect the deployment of 1inch to contribute to even greater adoption and usage of zkSync Era.”

Gluchowski said that 1inch Network’s position as the largest decentralized exchange aggregator by on-chain volume would provide deeper liquidity to zkSync Era. The deployment is also touted to offer faster trades, better rates and lower transaction slippage.

Related: Symbiosis integrates zkSync: ‘Natural evolution’ of scaling solutions

zkSync is among a number of layer-2 solutions that have pioneered the use of zk-rollups to increase Ethereum’s throughput and scalability. The technology enables layer-2 protocols to move computation and blockchain state storage offchain, allowing these platforms to process thousands of transactions before providing summary data proofs to Ethereum’s mainnet.

Matter Labs secured $200 million during a series-c investment round in November 2022, taking its total fundraising to over $450 million to continue the development of its Ethereum scaling platform.

Other major Ethereum development firms, including Polygon and ConsenSys, have also developed their own zk-proof powered scaling protocols. ConsenSys released its zkEVM rollup to its public testnet on March 28.

Meanwhile, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal described zk-rollups as “the holy grail of Ethereum scaling” upon the release of its open-source zkEVM Ethereum scaling technology to the mainnet on March 27.

Web3 users can now register decentralized .eth domains on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) protocol using a host of fiat payment options, including Apple Pay, and Google Pay, as well as debit and credit cards,

ENS announced the launch of a new fiat on-ramp for domain registrations through Web3 fiat payment gateway MoonPay on April 20. Registrations of .eth domains previously had to be paid for using Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 via cryptocurrency wallets, which was cited as a barrier to entry for prospective Web3 users.

MoonPay’s service has been integrated into the ENS website, while the platform also launched version 3 of its user interface to streamline sign-ups. This is aimed at eliminating the need for multiple transaction approvals previously required with cryptocurrency wallets.

A statement from ENS founder Nick Johnson highlighted the service’s focus on making Web3 “human-readable” to simplify the process of obtaining decentralized digital identities. ENS allows users to map human-readable names like “cointelegraph.eth” to machine-readable information like cryptocurrency addresses and URLs:

“This allows us to reach those who are either just entering the space or who are not yet comfortable with transacting and would prefer to use the currency and payment form they understand best.”

The upgrade of ENS’s platform is also touted to expand its usability beyond a primary use-case of creating human-readable names for wallets to replace numerical addresses typically generated by wallet service providers, platforms and blockchain protocols.

ENS users can use names to host censorship-resistant websites, which can be linked to conventional domain name service (DNS) addresses already in use.

Related: State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress

MoonPay’s vice president of partnerships, Bree Blazak, highlighted the integration with ENS as a means to create a simple payment experience for new users looking to obtain digital identities or decentralized domains:

“Our partnership with ENS delivers that by making it possible to buy a .eth name with some of the most familiar payment methods available.”

Ethereum Name Service hasseen over 2.3 million names created from more than 550,000 unique addresses. As Cointelegraph previously explored, decentralized domain name registrations have been on the rise over the past two years.

Both ENS and Unstoppable Domains have become leading platforms onboarding new users to the world of Web3 and decentralized identities. The latter also partnered with MoonPay to incorporate nonfungible token domains in transactions on the platform in July 2022.

Tornado Cash developer Alex Pertsev is set to be released from jail after spending nearly nine months in prison. Pertsev was arrested in August last year by Dutch authorities on suspicion of being involved in money laundering through the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.

Cointelegraph confirmed the news with the people familiar with the matter, and Pertsev is all set to be back home by April 26, which also happens to be his birthday. The suspended release under surveillance means the jailed Tornado cash developer can Jail can await trial from home.

Pertsev was arrested shortly after the United States Treasury Department placed dozens of Tornado Cash addresses on the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctions list on Aug. 8. 

The suspended release would see Pertsev put under supervision with an ankle monitor, according to Pertsev’s wife, who talked to Cointelegraph and expressed her happiness on the new:

“I believe that now we will be able to fully prepare the defense and prove that Alex did not do anything that he is accused of, and I am very sorry for the wasted time that he spent in prison. It had a powerful effect on him and on me; it cardinally changed our lives. But the main thing is that he will be free soon.”

Earlier, in November, a Dutch court denied the developer’s plea to be released under surveillance based on the prosecution’s argument that Pertsev posed a flight risk. The prosecution has argued that  Pertsev acted as a central figure in Tornado Cash’s operation. The developer’s bail was denied again in February.

Crypto mixers or mixing services are platforms that are often used to obfuscate the origin of crypto transactions. The aim of these mixers is to make transactions anonymous and difficult to trace. These platforms often mix one cryptocurrency transaction with others and send them to different wallet addresses. Tornado Cash was one of the most popular mixing services before sanctions.

The news about Pertsev’s release under surveillance was met with rejoicing in the crypto community. The founder of Crypto Canal, a crypto educator who attended the hearing, said that the most important thing is that Pertsev “can walk around and work on his defence, something that was virtually impossible while detained.”

Ethereum network’s gas fee skyrocketed to a new multi-month high amid a growing memecoin frenzy. The high transaction fee has swelled Ethereum’s daily revenue multifold compared to Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,795

. While Ethereum proponents celebrated the growth in revenue, many others were quick to point out the growing congestion on the network and the difficulty in processing transactions.

There was an unusual shift in the top 10 gas-burning altcoins where instead of ETH

The average gas price for Ethereum transactions as of April 20 was 81.94 gwei, up from 60.82 gwei on April 19 and 44.42 gwei last year — an increase of 34.74% from April 19 and 84.46% from April 20, 2022. Gwei is a denomination of the Ether and represents one billionth of one ETH.

Independent Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano shared the surge in daily fee revenue of the Ethereum network and said that the second-largest blockchain had brought in 28 times the revenue of Bitcoin. He also cited Ethereum layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum One that have outperformed the BTC network in terms of daily revenue due to the ongoing meme frenzy.

Ethereum proponent’s main argument is that the high gas fee and subsequent higher revenue highlight the network’s growing usability. However, many on Crypto Twitter were quick to point out that the extensive usage they are referring to is just a few thousand users gambling on memecoins.

A few users reportedly paid gas fees as high as a few hundred dollars, while others complained about having to pay a higher gas fee than the actual transaction.

Another prominent reason for the soaring gas fees was blamed on a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) trading bot that is front-running memecoin trades on a massive scale. The bot in question jaredfromsubway.eth has been the top gas spender in the last 24 hours, spending 455 ETH ($950,000) and using 7% of the total gas of the network.

Societe Generale-Forge (SG-Forge), a regulated subsidiary of the French banking firm Societe Generale, has launched EUR CoinVertible, the euro-pegged stablecoin for qualified institutional clients.

Announcing the news on April 20, SG-Forge said that the new stablecoin is based on the Ethereum blockchain and will be traded under the ticker symbol EURCV. The new digital asset will be only available to investors onboarded by Societe Generale through its existing Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering procedures.

“In the weeks to come, Societe Generale-Forge will assess the interest from prospective clients and respond to their questions for gradual adoption,” SG-Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger told Cointelegraph. The token will be available exclusively to institutional qualified investors through eligible market platforms, including crypto trading venues.

The EURCV stablecoin is designed to bridge the gap between traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem. SG-Forge decided to launch the digital asset in response to the growing demand for a new settlement asset for on-chain transactions. Other benefits of stablecoin include the activation of new solutions for corporate treasury, cash management and cash pooling activities, on-chain liquidity funding and refinancing solutions, the firm said.

The EUR CoinVertible stablecoin complies with major market standards, including the open-source interoperability and securitization framework known as Compliant Architecture for Security Token, or CAST, SG-Forge noted. The firm stressed that it will ensure “complete segregation” of the collateral assets backing the value of the stablecoins from the issuer and will provide daily transparency reports and collateral positions.

Stenger said the EUR CoinVertible smart contract has been audited by the professional services network PwC. For issuing the stablecoin, SG-Forge has been advised by the law firm White & Case. The role of the fiduciary is provided by Equitis Gestion, a private equity firm regulated by the French financial regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Additionally, the stablecoin has been developed in line with the upcoming European digital assets regulations known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA, framework.

SG-Forge CEO believes that stablecoins built under a banking-grade structure have a great potential to increase trust and confidence in the native crypto ecosystem. He said:

“This issuance is a major step in SG-Forge’s roadmap to deliver innovative solutions to its clients, either real-money institutions and corporates or entities of the crypto industry, and to facilitate the emergence of new market infrastructures based on blockchain.”

As one of the largest banks in France, Societe Generale has been progressing with cryptocurrency and blockchain-related services over the past few years. In September 2022, the company launched custodial services for crypto fund managers through its Security Services subsidiary. The firm has also been actively experimenting with issuing security tokens on blockchains such as Tezos.

Subway-themed trading bot makes millions using ‘sandwich’ attacks

The anonymous MEV bot operator’s best day was April 18, where he profited about $950,000.

An anonymous Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot operator has cashed in well over $1 million this week by executing “sandwich attacks” against buyers and sellers of two new meme coins.

The wallet address, linked to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain “jaredfromsubway.eth,” made $950,000 from the sandwich attacks on April 18 and profited about $300,000 and $400,000 on April 17 and 19, respectively, according to an April 19 tweet from nonfungible token data platform Sealaunch.

The bot’s ENS domain is a likely tongue-in-cheek nod to the popular sandwich chain and its disgraced former spokesperson Jared Fogle.

Over a 24-hour period between April 18 to 19, 7% of all Ethereum gas fees were spent by the MEV bot, Sealaunch explained in a separate post.

A large proportion of the profits came from attacks on trading activity relating to two new meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK), which has helped propel jaredfromsubway.eth to the become the largest gas guzzler over the last day and week, crypto researcher Matt Willemsen explained:

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

This is possible because the victim’s transaction is first sent to the mempool where it waits to be added to the next block. In the meantime, the attacker sets one transaction with a high gas fee — to ensure it is accepted first — and another transaction with a lower gas fee to ensure it is accepted after the victim's transaction.

The attacker profits by buying the victim’s token at a price cheaper than market value, then sells it within the same block — taking in the difference between the revenue from the transaction minus the gas fees.

The large profits pocketed by jaredfromsubway.eth came from nearly $1.2 million being spent on gas fees between April 18 and 19, according to data shared by Thomas Mattimore, head of platform at the Reserve Protocol.

The MEV bot operator has spent over $7 million in gas fees across 180,000 transactions, according to Sealaunch.

While some are finding the humor in the MEV bot’s domain name and actions, not all are happy.

One analyst for on-chain analytics firm Glassnode questioned the “value” of the work jaredfromsubway.eth is providing to the world.

Other Twitter users went one step further, expressing their hatred and frustration toward the MEV bot operator.

According to MEV Blocker, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from Ethereum users attempting to trade, provide liquidity and mint NFTs.

Several MEV Block projects have been launched in recent months to help protect Ethereum users from sandwich attacks.

A16z’s hyped-up orange balls revealed to be an L2 rollup client

A series of cryptic tweets depicting orange balls were revealed to be building up hype for a new rollup client for Optimism (OP) called “Magi” from the crypto arm of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16z).

An April 19 Tweet from a16z engineer Noah Citron explained Magi is written in the programming language Rust and will “help improve the client diversity and resilience of the entire OP Stack ecosystem.”

The OP Stack refers to the set of software that powers the Ethereum layer-2 solution Optimism. Among the other benefits it provides, it helps simplify the process of creating layer-2 blockchains.

Citron explained Magi “takes the place of a consensus client (often called rollup client) in the OP Stack, and works alongside an execution client such as op-geth to sync,” meaning that it allows the Ethereum chain to advance by feeding new blocks to the execution client.

The lead engineer for Coinbase’s layer-2 solution Base, Jesse Pollak, also chimed in on the announcement, tweeting that “magi means more decentralization, security, and scale for the OP Stack.”

In an April 19 blog post, Citron opined that decentralization increases network security, which is “critically important for rollups” just as it is for the base layer of Ethereum.

A16z’s cryptic hype orange circle tweets echoed the way Coinbase hyped and introduced its own layering network called Base, which instead featured tweets of a blue circle.

Related: US share of global crypto developers fell 26% in 5 years — a16z

Citron kicked off the hype train with a tweet of an orange circle on April 18 bearing the phrase “coming soon.”

Its similarity to the hype before the announcement of Base prompted the crypto community to theorize another Ethereum layer-2 solution was imminent before a16z’s chief technology officer, Eddy Lazzarin, quashed the rumors.

Citron also noted that Magi is still currently in development, and while it can currently sync to the Optimism testnet it will be some months before it is production-ready.

Right as some analysts thought that Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,795

 was on the cusp of confirming a new bull market, the cryptocurrency market took a downturn amid regulatory uncertainty and signs of weakening macroeconomic conditions. 

Crypto market down 4%, Bitcoin below $30,000

Bitcoin price hit a 7-day low on April 19 at $29,158 after failing to maintain the key $30,000 level. Moreover, some traders are worried that a further correction could revisit the bear market lows.

Similar worries exist for Ether 

ETH

$1,853

, which breached the $2,100 level post-Shapella upgrade and hit a 11-month high, followed by a 7-day low of $1,972 on April 19 despite ETH staking deposits surpassing withdrawals the day before.

U.S. regulatory crackdown fears

On April 18, Gary Genseler, the SEC Chair, appeared before the United States House Financial Services Committee for an oversight hearing, which likely spooked crypto traders.

During the hearing, Gensler refused to definitively answer whether Ethereum was a commodity or security despite repeated requests from committee members to do so. 

On April 17, the SEC filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange, Bittrex. The lawsuit alleges Bittrex was operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.

Gensler issued the following warning,

“If this field has any chance of survival and success, it’s time-tested rules and laws to protect the investing public. Don’t have your hand in the customer’s pocket, using their funds for your own platform.”
Hawkish Fed, weaker economy weigh on risk- assets

Despite banking crisis fears and hopes of a dovish U-turn, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell seems committed to reducing inflation through further hikes.

Powell and the Fed continue to reiterate the goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. In a press conference on March 28, Powell reiterated,

“We remain committed to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.”

The market seems to agree that interest rates will continue to rise with the next Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for May 3, 2023.

This will be an important date for cryptocurrency investors as well since the sector is still highly correlated with the Dow and S&P 500.

Meanwhile, the Fed is fighting headwinds of its own as major banks still expect the U.S. to experience a sharp recession at some point in 2023 that will likely push down risk-on asset prices including cryptocurrencies. 

According to U.S. Bank analysis, investor sentiment about the current state of the economy remains low and trending downwards.

According to U.S. Bank, 

“Inflation, interest rates and earnings remain key to equity returns. Persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and uncertainty over the pace of earnings growth in 2023 remain headwinds to advancing equity prices.”

The OpenZeppelin Defender smart contract security platform has now integrated with Coinbase’s Base network, allowing Web3 app developers on Base to automate security tasks.

According to an April 19 announcement from blockchain cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin, app developers on Base can now use the Defender software to create multi-signature admin contracts and timelocks, employ Relayers to store keys and sign transactions along with creating automated “sentinels” to monitor the blockchain and react when events occur.

These tools can be used for routine but sensitive admin tasks such as upgrading contracts, tweaking numerical parameters, or pausing a contract should an emergency occur according to the program’s documentation.

The Defender app was available on Ethereum and most other networks in the past, but as it was not integrated with Base, developers could not use it on the new testnet until now.

OpenZeppelin chief technology officer Jonathan Alexander stated in the announcement that the integration will make smart contracts ""more secure and expansive,” while Base lead Jesse Pollak signaled excitement at the team-up, saying that “security is key for a thriving onchain ecosystem.""

Coinbase announced the launch of the Base test network on Feb. 23. It plans to produce a mainnet version as a layer-2 of Ethereum once testing is complete.

Some Ethereum users have speculated that Coinbase wants to help onboard institutional investors to Web3 through the new network as it will feature Masa Finance identity verification tools.

OpenZeppelin is most known for its library of open-source smart contracts that are often modified by developers and used for their own purposes throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.
